People from all over {Spira}
gather here.
{NEWPAGE}

The monks of {Yevon2}, the {Al Bhed2},
{Crusader}s, warrior monks, {Ronso},
{Guado}, you name it.
{NEWPAGE}

People of different cultures and
values come together as one to
cheer on blitzball.
{NEWPAGE}

There is no other place in {Spira}
as wonderful as this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There hasn't been any major incident since
the fiend attack. Just kids who get lost
in the stadium now and then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We no longer have the strength
to fight...
{NEWPAGE}

Should the fiends reappear, run
for your lives!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the citizens' pitching in, the
stadium has been repaired in no time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please do not throw objects or lean
against the railing at any time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sphere pictures are allowed, but
please refrain from using a flash.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The crowd and the players went wild
when the ship flew by!
It was a struggle to keep 'em under control.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks have left, but the
{Crusader}s are back to help guard the area.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't want the warrior monks stationed
inside the stadium. They're too uptight.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The fiends broke in, all because the
{Crusader}s ditched guard duty this year.
{NEWPAGE}

It's all their fault! They should
have been helping us instead of
devising some foolish plan!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are dreamin'!
Do they really think the operation will succeed?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though the grand maester
is here, we're short on security.
{NEWPAGE}

If only the {Crusader}s were
still here like last year...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone in {Spira} has been looking
forward to this tournament.
No one would dare disrupt it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Such a free-spirited city...
I do not wish to return to Bevelle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm off duty.
Let me be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nothing beats watching a blitz game
after a long stint at sea.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since games are played every day,
the guards are always on duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Incompetent guardians! That's why so many
summoners are vanishing, I tell you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard {Master Seymor} helped kill off
some {sinspawn} at {Operation Mi'ihen}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even with the recent fiend scare,
I can't believe how crowded it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's too bad the {Aurochs}' record
losing streak had to end. That was
the only thing going for them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those fiends really put a
damper on the tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was watching {Master Seymor}'s
aeon from here. It was awesome!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Games are held every day,
even after the tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2} has already
returned to {Bevelle}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka}'s pretty beat up.
I don't think he'll play in the finals.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like the {Aurochs} are burnt out.
They don't stand a chance in the finals.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must be dreaming.
The {Aurochs} are in the finals?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you doing out here?
You should be out there by the
bench cheering on your teammates!
--------------------------------------------------End--

No need to watch this match.
We all know the {Aurochs} are
gonna lose the first round anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why aren't you out there playing?
You're pretty confident for an {Aurochs} player.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've decided to stay in {Luca} until
the Calm comes. The more, the merrier
when it comes to celebrations.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a flying ship by the dock.
When do you think it'll fight {Sin}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

So many people...
Much more than in the {Calm Lands}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've seen many things in my time at sea, but
nothing like that flying ship at dock number 1.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only the {Guado2} and the warrior monks
are guarding the streets. Why aren't
they asking the {Ronso} for help?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope watching the game will ease the
Crusaders' pain over their dreadful defeat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Ronso} warriors value their horns, and
the people of {Luca} value blitzball.
--------------------------------------------------End--

True believers of the teachings
will not support the {Crusader}s.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many {Ronso} have left {Luca} to guard
their sacred mountain, {Gagazet}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Throughout the long history of {Yevon2},
this is the first time a summoner has
ever been appointed maester.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You have to admire the {Aurochs}' fighting spirit.
But the {Ronso} warriors deserve some credit, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs}' victory must be a
blessing from {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those {Al Bhed} players are playing well.
You can tell they're hungry for the championship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Psyches and the {Aurochs} are
not enemies of the {Ronso Fangs}.
