I'll bet you anything the {Luca Goers}
are gonna win again this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe so, but you'd better not
count out the {Kilika Beasts}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid Aurochs}? Win?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that's funny! Hahaha!
{NEWPAGE}

Gimme a break, man!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have sealed off all access to
the stadium for the time being.
{NEWPAGE}

We're trying to control the mad rush of
people who have already entered the stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We apologize for the inconvenience, but
access to the stadium has been sealed off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2} has ruled Spira
for the past fifty years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Man, this tournament is gonna rock!
Even the big man is here to see the game.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I can catch one glimpse of Maester {Mika},
I'll have something to brag about back home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester {Mika} doesn't make many public
appearances. He's getting too old for that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm glad I got here safely.
Don't want another S.S. Liki incident.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ladies and gentlemen, the day
we've all been waiting for!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening tournament
of the season!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This event is sponsored by {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And this year we celebrate
{Maester Mika}'s 50th year in office.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, over there!
The ships carrying the
players are arriving now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This would be dock number 2.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're a living, breathing,
statistical impossibility!
I've never seen a team this bad!
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's right!
In twenty-three years they've
never made it past the first round!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only a few die-hard fans
are in the audience today.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Best of luck to them, and a
safe journey back to {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Right, Jimma.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Moving right along,
our next team is...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here they are, folks!
Our very own {Luca Goers}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They've got power!
They've got speed!
They've got teamwork!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're an all-around first-class team!
And they're back home in Luca!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Without a doubt, they are
the favorite this year, Bobba.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And after the way they dominated
last year, it'd take a miracle
for them to lose today.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You can say that again, Jimma.
Look at the crowd, folks!
Look at the crowd!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like all of Luca has turned
out to cheer the Goers on!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They know, I know,
and you know, folks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Luca Goers} are number one!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
It's like this every year, ya?
Don't let it bother you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Stop right there, Goers!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You guys are smilin' now,
but not for long!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
'Cause this year, us
{Aurochs} are taking the cup!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
What in {Yevon2}'s name
were you doing up there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
We sure stood out, though!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
We were on the sphere!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We were?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika} is here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Already?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The number 3 dock!
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What's up now?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Maester Mika} has arrived, that's what!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Mika? Maester?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Maester Mika} is the leader of
all the peoples of {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
He's come all the way from {Bevelle}.
The tournament is being held to
honor his fifty years as maester.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Fifty years? Shouldn't he
be, uh, retired by now?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Hey!
Mind your mouth, now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Let's all go see him!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Map jump here
--------------------------------------------------End--
Image from a different map.
Image inserting movie.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All the way from {Kilika},
it's the {Kilika Beasts}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

High Summoner {Ohalland} used to play
for them--a big name to live up to.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Their hometown was recently attacked
by {Sin}. Isn't that right, Jimma?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, Bobba. They're going to
be pulling out all the stops to try
and bring back the cup this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Exciting, isn't it, folks?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our next team off the ramp is...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, well, well!
If it isn't the {Besaid Aurochs}!
