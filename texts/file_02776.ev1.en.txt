The hymn we all sang at the stadium
is still echoing in my ears.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of Luca will always
stand behind a blitzer--
even one condemned as a traitor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The stadium is now open.
You may enter freely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The first match has already begun.
Please hurry to your seat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We are currently assessing the damage
from the fiends. No admittance.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Access is no longer restricted.
Feel free to enter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder who the next grand maester will be...
I need to book someone for next year's
opening speech.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Most of the warrior monks have withdrawn to
Bevelle, but some have taken a liking to Luca
and remained here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even now that the tournament's over,
the stadium is always jam-packed.
That's Luca for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm right by the stadium, but I can't
watch the game. What a bummer...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you forget something inside?
Give it up. I doubt you'll find it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It took forever to fix the
stands inside the stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The stadium is surrounded by numerous
ports laid out in a circular fashion.
{NEWPAGE}

So it's impossible to get lost.
Turn here to get to {Blue}dock number {VAR12:30}{White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even through all the hardship, the people of Luca
enjoy blitzball and carry on with their lives.
Oh, how I admire their strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We are protecting Luca under Maester Kinoc's
orders. You should all be grateful!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the operation succeeds.
I want to come back here next year...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the tournament is over, the
operation will commence. Better
enjoy blitzball while I still can.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The merchants of Luca have raised
money to support the Crusaders.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So many Crusaders have died and yet people
are watching blitzball? This city is heartless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am relieved the grand maester is safe.
We owe it all to {Master Seymor}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Crusaders were in charge of guarding
the stadium up until last year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But they're all busy preparing for
the operation now. So this year, the
citizens have taken up security posts.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard Sin has fallen in Bevelle!
Could it be that the Calm is almost here?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've decided to join the Crusaders.
No sense hiding behind their back all the time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like that last machina attack sent
Sin back to sea for now. Let's hope we
get some peace and quiet for awhile.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ending the tournament with the fiend
attack left a bad taste in my mouth.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Goers are definitely gonna win.
Everyone else is goin' down!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Crusaders will help us with security.
We will support them all the way!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks are helping us out,
so guard duty's not as bad as before.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please report any suspicious activity.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the Calm will last at least a year.
Would three be asking for too much?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think the Crusaders are more suited
to Luca than the warrior monks are.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks are planning to guard the
ferries. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2} returned to {Bevelle}
soon after the tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tickets were so hard to come by this year.
Oh, well... Guess I'll watch the game over
at the cafe.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once Sin is gone for good, I hope you play
every day! I'll be there to cheer you on!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, when are you playin' next?
I really want to see you again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I really enjoyed your awesome moves!
I hope I get to see you play more often.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nice work out there.
Now I know you're not all talk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw your rallying cry on the sphere.
Heheh, best of luck to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you know that you're more popular than
ever, now that you're branded as a traitor?
--------------------------------------------------End--

No one knows who unleashed the
fiends into the stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm afraid to imagine what would've
happened if {Master Seymor} hadn't been here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Players must return to their locker
room for the opening ceremony.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will fight as a Crusader until
Spira is rid of all fiends.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I quit the Crusaders after the operation,
but I'm back in again. I think I have Crusader
blood running through my veins.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The captain's making me work
so that he can go see the game!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will be heading for the operation soon.
I must bid adieu to the city of {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm rooting for the Al Bhed Psyches this year.
They're helping out the Crusaders, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The flying ship at dock 1
is the legendary airship!
So the tales are true!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have resumed ferry operation.
We're as busy as ever.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sin is lurking in the waters nearby.
Ferry service has been postponed indefinitely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the ships don't leave the port during
the tournament. Just kick back and relax, man.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the Crusaders regroup in Luca, they
will charge through the Mi'ihen Highroad
and lay waste to all the fiends!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please report any suspicious
activity to me immediately!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s have planned a grand
operation to smash the fiends.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I should be reporting to the base by now,
but I just want to catch one glimpse of the
opening ceremony.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the Calm arrives, we must have a
commemorative tournament! Actually,
we're already in the planning stages.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks have left, but the
Crusaders have returned to serve as guards.
A blessing from Yevon indeed!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple has dispatched their warrior monks
to guard the stadium. I am thankful, indeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We were supposed to get some time off after
the tournament, but with the sudden fiend
incident and all, we're busy with the investigation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aren't you a blitzer?
Better check the rules while you still can.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony is about to begin.
All players must wait in their locker rooms.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're not a blitzer, are you?
Nah, couldn't be. The game's already started.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're still investigating how
the fiends managed to get in.
