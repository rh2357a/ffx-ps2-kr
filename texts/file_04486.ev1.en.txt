I have no idea what I was thinking
when I ran after {Sin} that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But before I knew what I was doing,
there I was chasing him down like a
thief at market.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe I was angry,
maybe I wanted to go home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I kept thinking of {Zanarkand},
and my old man.
