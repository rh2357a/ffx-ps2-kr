{Tidus}
Uh, what's a "sending"?
Are we going somewhere?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
You truly are clueless.
Are you sure it's just your
memory that's the problem?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The dead need guidance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Filled with grief over
their own death, they
refuse to face their fate.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
They yearn to live on, and
resent those still alive.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
You see, they envy the living.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
And in time, that envy
turns to anger, even hate.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Should these souls remain in
{Spira}, they become fiends
that prey on the living.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Sad, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The sending takes them to
the {Farplane}, where they
may rest in peace.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Summoners do this?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It must be tough,
being a summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Yuna} chose her own path. She knew
from the beginning what it meant.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
All we can do is protect
her along the way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Until the end.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Until the...end?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What's the end?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Until she defeats {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I hope...
I hope I did okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
You did very well!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
They've reached the {Farplane} by now.
But...no tears next time, hm?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wished there would
never be a next time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No more people being killed by {Sin}.
No more sendings for {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone stood there watching her.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was strange, and somehow...horrifying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I never wanted to see it again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

"Youth,
tread quietly upon the ground."
--------------------------------------------------End--
