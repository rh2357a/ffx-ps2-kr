{Wakka}
Wha...what was that just now?
That really Lord {Jyscal}?

{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Wait, I know!
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:31}Just listen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
He wasn't sent,
so he became a fiend, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I don't understand how a man like
Lord {Jyscal} could die and not be sent.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
I would think that he was sent once...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
but he stayed on {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Something, a powerful emotion could have
bound him to this world. Such things happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rikku}
That's against the rules, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It means he died an unclean death.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell}
Come to kill the old man?
I welcome it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell}
Or are you here to laugh?
Laugh at the fallen {Guado}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
