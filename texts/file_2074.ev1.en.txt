It was then, standing in that place.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I began to realize how different
this world was from my own.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ten years have passed since
Lord {Braska} became high summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And finally we receive
a statue for our temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What's a high summoner?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I...I got too close to {Sin}'s, uh, toxin.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was funny hearing myself make
the same excuse over and over.
Funny, and a little sad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The summoners are practitioners
of a sacred art, sworn to protect
the people of {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only a chosen few become summoners,
who call forth entities of great power:
the aeons.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The aeons hear our prayers
and come down to us.
They are the blessing of {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So what he meant...
--------------------------------------------------End--

was that we should respect some kinda
great men or something like that...
I figured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only sworn guardians may
approach the Cloister of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pray hard, and the toxin will
surely release its grip on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The high summoners, in order from the
right: Lord {Braska}, Lady Yocun...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord Ohalland, and Lord Gandof.
Do you remember them now?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{High Summoner Gandof}, give us your
blessing, and watch over my family.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village was attacked by {Sin}
when I was just a little kid, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

The village was burnt to ashes.
I still have nightmares of that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't bother people when they're
praying! It's against the teachings!
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the apprentice summoner
return to us safely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am sure that Lord {Braska} is
watching over our apprentice summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Me favorite's Lord Ohalland, ya?
Spitting image of me old hubby.
--------------------------------------------------End--
