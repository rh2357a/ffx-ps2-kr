Obtained {Jecht}'s sphere!

{WINDOW}
{WINDOW}
{Yellow}{Jecht}'s Spheres{White}
Spheres that document {Jecht}'s journey are
hidden all over {Spira}. Defeating the
Spherimorph has unlocked the seals
that once bound the spheres. Find them!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
This place...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It's just water, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
This is what spheres are made of.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It absorbs and preserves
people's memories.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
What's that?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Fiends are also
attracted to these places.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Whoa, this is old!
Don't know if you can play it back.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} left it here ten years ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Play it back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

          
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What's the point?
He wasn't on some pleasure cruise.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rikku}
I think there's more.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
He sounded almost serious,
but it was too late.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
He was serious.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} had already
accepted his fate.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
His fate?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht}... He...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
He was always talking
about going home, to {Zanarkand}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
That's why he took all those pictures--
to show them to you when he returned.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
But as he journeyed with us
and came to understand {Spira},
and {Braska}'s resolve...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It happened gradually,
but {Jecht} changed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
He decided he would join {Braska}
in his fight against {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So then, he gave up going home?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
That was his decision.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I guess I understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My old man...
--------------------------------------------------End--

He knew there was no way
back home, back to {Zanarkand}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He wanted to go home,
but he knew he couldn't.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He couldn't go on
until he accepted it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Besides...
--------------------------------------------------End--

even if he had
found a way back...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't think he would've
left his friends behind before
their journey was complete.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
All right!
Let's go, guys!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe I had to start
accepting my own fate.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Yeah?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} loved you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Oh, come on, please!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
He just didn't know how
to express it, he said.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Enough about my old man, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
I just thought you should know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------End--
