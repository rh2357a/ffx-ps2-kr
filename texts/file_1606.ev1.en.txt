{Wakka}
But, this is an {Al Bhed} shop!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Is that a problem?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
They don't believe in {Yevon2},
and in Luca they... 
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
They kidnapped {Yuna}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Where were her guardians?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Sir {Auron}'s just concerned
about your health.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
I'm not tired one bit!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Well I am.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
To the chocobo corral!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Now I know I can count on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Gimme a break. I just woke up.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Like you did much!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It was your idea to fight that thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
If you're always so groggy,
just stay awake.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Yeah right, thanks for the tip.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin}
Have you an interest in
renting some chocobos?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin}
As a token of our gratitude,
the first time is free of charge.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin}
Please ask the attendant,
if you wish to rent.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you so much
for saving the chocobos!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hello!
No charge this time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You get to ride a chocobo once for
free, but I see you already have one.
{NEWPAGE}

You can rent one free next time, then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you want to ride a chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you want me to teach you
how to ride a chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please be careful on your trip.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Summoners and guardians!
I saw the fight. I was impressed!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Right now we're charged with
getting people off the Highroad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
But you... Well, you have a
have a summoner, so you can stay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Don't tell anyone,
but this is a really boring job.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Oh, I took care of
that fiend for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some harsh words have been
directed at us {Al Bhed} lately.
{NEWPAGE}

They say it is our fault that the
operation failed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am used to being hated, but now
I do not feel like working anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am fed up of working with morons.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're keeping an eye on the {Al Bhed2}
so they don't take advantage of the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We got off the ship with the children
under the orders of Elder {Cid}.
{NEWPAGE}

The elder probably senses it will be
a tough battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray for your safety. I do not wish
harm on any more people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The children are happy.
Everything is so new to them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must watch over the children. It is
dangerous here. They could fall off the cliff.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will be angry if those {Yevon2} monks
hurt the children.
{NEWPAGE}

I do not think they will, but
I cannot trust them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I hear the word {Yevon2}, I think of
the {fiend} attack on our {Home}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I guess all children are innocent,
whether they are ours or {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As a {Yevon2} monk, I have denounced the
{Al Bhed2} for defying the teachings.
{NEWPAGE}

By doing so, I have only stirred senseless
conflicts throughout {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

I deeply regret my folly.

I wanted to ride on the ship, too.
It was a great battle, right?

Huh? The battle is not over?
Then maybe we should sing again.

That is the biggest puddle
I have ever seen!

There are many unusual plants.
I wonder how they taste.

Take good care of them when you
