{Auron}
This may well answer
a few questions.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Wonderful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rikku}
Will {Yuna} be all right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Without us, no.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Where you goin'?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You saw, didn't you?
{Seymor}'s bad news!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
But he's a maester!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Fine! Stay here if you want!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Come on, {Wakka}.
Let's at least hear him out.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
This can't be happening.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Jyscal}... How horrifying!
I shall pretend I did not witness that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This does not bode well.
Please be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ever since that incident involving
Lord {Seymor}, I've had a hard time
sleeping at night.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wish I'd never seen that sphere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe what the sphere has shown!
There must be some mistake.
{NEWPAGE}

I shall keep the sphere safe here,
and return it to Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple undergoes its
own trial of faith, now.
{NEWPAGE}

If only a leader would appear
to restore its former glory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In time, the {Guado2} will come
to see the light of {Yevon2}, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
