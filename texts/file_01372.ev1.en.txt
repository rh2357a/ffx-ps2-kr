{Wakka}
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It was {Dona} and that
big musclehead man!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Yuna} will be the one
to suffer the consequences!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What consequences?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
She could be excommunicated!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The chamber beyond is a sacred
place. Only summoners may enter.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What, even guardians can't go?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
It's taboo!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Just wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So, what's in there anyway?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
The {fayth}, remember?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Oh yeah, that thing. Right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The {fayth} are people who
gave their lives to battle {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Yevon2} took their souls, willingly
given from their still-living bodies.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Now they live forever,
trapped in statues.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
But when a summoner beckons, the
souls of the {fayth} emerge once again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
That's what we call an aeon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
All that in this room?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
S-So what's {Yuna}
doing in there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
She prays with all her heart
for a way to defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--


There was something I didn't
tell anyone else that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That song we heard there, in the temple...
I knew it from my childhood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was proof that {Spira} and
{Zanarkand} were connected somehow.
At least to me it was.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe that's why, suddenly, I felt
like...I just wanted to go home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I tried to say something, to tell them.
But the words wouldn't come.
--------------------------------------------------End--
