{Lulu}
I need to be alone right now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
I hope I'll bring back...good news.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell}
Oh, my poor Lord {Seymor}...
Tell me, where do you wander?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell}
Lord {Jyscal}!
I beg your forgiveness!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell}
Even should {Sin} disappear, the
{Guado} are doomed without a leader.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the summoner's sending
the fallen ones to the {Farplane}...
{NEWPAGE}

we were able to reunite with our son,
who was killed in battle.
{NEWPAGE}

Words cannot express how
grateful we are.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The summoner's sending has saved
our son from becoming a fiend.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our son was killed in
{Operation Mi'ihen}.
{NEWPAGE}

We begged him not to go,
but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Never did I imagine our son
would depart before our time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The two figures you see there
are not his mother and father.
{NEWPAGE}

Actually, they are my parents,
who passed away decades ago.
{NEWPAGE}

They died young, but I was fortunate
enough to have grandchildren.
{NEWPAGE}

My parents must have been watching
over me from the {Farplane}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It feels quite strange to look
older than your own parents.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They look exactly
like my mom and dad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All your hard work and effort to
become a monk has been in vain.
{NEWPAGE}

Oh, how I was looking
forward to that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rest in peace on the {Farplane}.
We shall join you soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope you live your next life
in a world without {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

Do not return to {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those who are born into {Spira}
are destined to live a life of sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
