{Yuna}
Goodbye.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lady {Yuna}!
Don't forget me, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be good while you're
gone! I promise, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, take this. Daddy
says it's an offering.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have to keep watch!
{Sin} could come any day!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When are the {Aurochs}
gonna come back?
--------------------------------------------------End--

All I wanna do is join the Crusaders,
but they say I'm too young!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if the fiends will
go away once Sin's gone...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll miss Lady Yuna!
Come back soon, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where are you going
on that big boat?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When is Lady {Yuna} going
to bring us the Calm?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Look at me! I'm Lady {Yuna}!
I'll be a summoner when I grow up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a ship, flying in the sky!
I saw it! Honest!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sung and everything, so now
Lady {Yuna}'s Calm will come, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard there's some foreigners around.
Be on your guard!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There was a summoner here a while ago.
One of his guardians was my age!
{NEWPAGE}

His name was {Pacce} or something.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some mean-looking people were here,
looking for {Yuna}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if all this singing's
really gonna help beat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I knew this time would
come someday. I knew.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please watch over Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, have this.
You may find use for it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A summoner arrived
here just recently.
{NEWPAGE}

He seemed to have disappeared.
But where to, so quickly?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I believe his name was
Lord {Isaaru}...yes, that's it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard the sailors' gossip
about Lady {Yuna} getting married?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I should think Lady {Yuna} would be the
last to marry and quit her pilgrimage!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Besaid} are friends to Lady {Yuna}.
Come to us if you are ever in need.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship--now that's what
I call a blessing of {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got separated from Sir {Luzzu}
and {Gatta} during the battle.
{NEWPAGE}

They haven't come back yet.
Where could they be?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That new plan, it must be working.
I mean, I haven't seen {Sin} around, have you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, no one's loafing around here!
I'm keeping a lookout for {Sin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is still out there.
This is a job for the {Crusader}s!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Haven't seen {Sin} in a long while.
Perhaps the {Crusader}s have stopped it at last?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh hoh hoh, have I news for you!
{NEWPAGE}

The daughter of Lord {Braska}
is to marry the leader of the {Guado}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? Already knew, did you?
Hmph. You're no fun.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're getting fewer and fewer
passengers--maybe due to all
the turmoil in the temples.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just once in my life,
I'd like to ride on a flying ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh! There are so many
things I want to tell her.
{NEWPAGE}

But seeing her there, smiling...
I just can't say them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, you! The sea's crawling with
fiends, so give this to {Yuna}, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't cry...
I won't, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're really leaving.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, a farewell gift
from all the village.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understand why some people
didn't come down here.
{NEWPAGE}

It's hard to say goodbye.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May {Yevon2}'s blessings be with
our summoner on her pilgrimage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, a gift from the temple
to sanctify her departure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The journey will be long. Believe the
teachings, and you will not go astray.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're headed for {Blue}{Kilika Island}{White}.
All aboard!
