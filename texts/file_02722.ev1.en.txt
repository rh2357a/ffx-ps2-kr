My Lady Summoner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a summoner?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes.
My name is {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm Calli.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Nice to meet you, Calli.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Calli
Lady {Yuna}, are you going
to bring us the {Calm}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes, very soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Calli
Yay!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're looking forward to another
{Calm}, My Lady Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'll do my best.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And good luck to your guardians as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What's the calm?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The {Calm} is a time of peace.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
It comes after a summoner defeats
{Sin}, and lasts until {Sin} reappears.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Sin} dies and is reborn.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I get it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I thought it was weird.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
{Yuna}'s dad defeated {Sin}
ten years ago, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
But {Sin}'s still here!
Didn't make much sense till now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Wait...
If it just comes back...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Don't say it isn't worth it...
Because it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even for a little while...
--------------------------------------------------End--

people can sleep in their
beds without being afraid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That kind of time is worth anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say it isn't worth it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your words that day, {Yuna}--
I remember them well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watch out. There are fiends everywhere.
Here, you can have this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This ring helps keep flames at bay.
Please, give it to the lady summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm watching the {Crusader}s pass by.
They look cool.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Should I become a {Crusader} or a
blitzer when I grow up? I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My sister's waiting for me, but who cares?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey! That was my ball!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Gee, you really socked that puppy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why don't you become a blitzer?
Maybe someday you can play for the Goers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whaddya want!
I'm in a hurry here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're gonna kill me
if I'm late for the operation!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They won't...be able to...
defeat {Sin}...without my...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whew...
At this rate, I'll croak sooner than {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, sir! On patrol, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Normally we patrol the area of
operation with chocobos.
{NEWPAGE}

But we couldn't muster the funds
for any more chocobos.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Usually the temple contributes some,
but not for this operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure if we defeat {Sin},
{Yevon2} will finally bless us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're raising funds at the end of
the Highroad. We're counting on you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks are real stiffs,
really unapproachable.
{NEWPAGE}

But I am grateful to them for
guarding the Highroad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A warrior monk got mad at me.
{NEWPAGE}

He said I can't play anymore,
because there are fiends here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard so much noise
during the operation.
{NEWPAGE}

Was that the sound of machina?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fiends stalk the area, but people
just stroll through anyway.
{NEWPAGE}

It doesn't make our job any easier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't stray off the road.
Make our job a little easier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I fled {Bevelle} and came here.
I got sick of living there.
{NEWPAGE}

It was so unsettling, what with the priests'
meddling and the warrior monks' arrogance.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yevon2} had better start
getting its act together.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm not playing. I'm practicing
with my brother.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's important to train.
You never know what's gonna happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have to become strong like my brother
so that I'll be able to run away like him
if fiends attack us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My sister wanted to play, so we came here.
I just didn't expect to see so many fiends.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll have no problems outrunning fiends,
but I doubt my sister could.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm gonna pray we don't run into any.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If there were no fiends in {Spira},
we wouldn't even have to worry like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My grandpa and I... We used to take
a stroll through here almost every day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yevon2}'s blessing has granted me sound
health, but grandpa...
{NEWPAGE}

He's been blessed with too much energy.
He marched on down to go see {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Grandpa said he'd go fetch me a sinscale.
{NEWPAGE}

When he's gonna act his own age,
I can't say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother and I were playing. Then a
fiend came out, and he ran away without me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He ran so fast.
My brother is the best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm gonna practice running.
I'm gonna beat my brother someday.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll protect {Spira} from now on.
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} beat us last time, but I'm okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you know {Sin}'s weakness?
Tell me, and I'll kill it for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you get attacked by fiends,
you can come to us for help.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Our prayers are with you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
