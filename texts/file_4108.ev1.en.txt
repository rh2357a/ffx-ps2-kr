{Yuna}
Lady Yunalesca!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
She was the first person to defeat {Sin}
and save the world from its ravages.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
And you have inherited her name.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It was my father who named me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
Lord {Braska} was entrusting
you with a great task.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
He wanted you to face {Sin},
as Lady Yunalesca did.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
However, Lady Yunalesca
did not save the world alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
To defeat the undefeatable {Sin}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymor}
it took an unbreakable bond of love--
of the kind that binds two hearts
for eternity.
--------------------------------------------------End--
