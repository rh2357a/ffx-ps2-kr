{Dona}
Look, I'm really tired.
Leave me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
If it's not an emergency,
would you mind leaving?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Wait... There's something
I want to ask you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
What would you think if I said
I...I was giving up my pilgrimage?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Sure! Sounds good to me.
{CHOICE:31}Who cares?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Unusual.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Most people would never
forgive a summoner who quit.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Why's that?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Behind my back, they would
say I was abandoning my duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So, who cares?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Why not do your own thing and
let them say what they want!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Easy for you to say.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
But...you do have a point.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Maybe {Barthello} and I should
go someplace far away.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Show some sympathy!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Oh, like all the sympathy you
showed me first time we met?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
You're right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Quitting now would be
sort of anti-climactic, no?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Tell {Yuna} something, would you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Tell her she still has a rival: me!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Tell her she'd better
do her best, or be bested.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
You'll tell her, won't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
Thanks for the company.
I feel so much better now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
It's too cramped
to call aeons here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}
I'll leave this fight to you.
Show us your stuff!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru}
We'll leave the other
compartments to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Years of sweat and toil to build
it, and now {Home} is rubble!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come, {Guado}! I challenge you!
I will fight till you are all dust!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must tell the other players
in {Luca} what has happened!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My friends, they died protecting
{summoner}. I will do the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We don't know how {Sin} will react.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you are prepared, we can
attack {Sin} at any time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The gravity, it bends!
And with {Sin} at the center!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is still living.
How will we stop it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You attack from the front?
It is a crazy, but delightful plan!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let us destroy {Sin}
once and for all!
--------------------------------------------------End--

No time for tears and shouting!
All we must do is rebuild our {Home}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Okay, okay!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I finally have figured out how
it is that this ship is moved.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you battle with {Sin}
I will be singing too, yes!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Leave the ship to my hands!
You go now to the deck!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ship must be tuned to
be ready for the final fight!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our ship is in top shape!
Now, go and fell the great {Sin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ship is fine, even
inside {Sin}, I think.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hit my head when the ship shook.
Now I have a lump!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not scared, not scared!
Not scared, not scared!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When will we go {Home}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even without our {Home}, we must
live on! I only hope I am able.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The corridor is protected by {summoner}.
So this room should be safe!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We left kids on the ground.
Safer for them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am glad you made it back from {Bevelle}.
They didn't welcome us last time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will sing here too!
Good luck!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish to be done with battle,
to see my little brother again!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not be lazy!
{Sin} is right before us!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the {Calm} comes,
{Home} must be rebuilt.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Poor child, he does not understand
that our {Home} is no more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chased by {fiend}! We are all
very tired, and very scared.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It pains me most to see
the children so scared.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {summoner} and {guardian}
seem full of worry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can use a weapon!
I will show them how {Al Bhed} fight!
--------------------------------------------------End--

These things here belong to Mister {Rin}.
They are not yours to take!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There is much to buy,
so do not be shy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you have all that you need?
Talk to Mister {Rin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We must repair the damaged ship.
But have we the parts?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It will be a battle most violent!
Check that you have all you need!
--------------------------------------------------End--

All that is here is at your
disposal! Be prepared!
--------------------------------------------------End--
