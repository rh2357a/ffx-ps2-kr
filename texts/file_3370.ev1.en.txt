I'm supposed to study real
hard and become a nun.
{NEWPAGE}

But I just wanna run around
and play at the beach.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I ignored the precepts and
went into the cloister once.
{NEWPAGE}

Boy, did I get in trouble!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to the Crusaders?
They all look so sad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're supposed to sing when we see
the flying ship, right? See, I knew that!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We saw the flying ship so we all sang our
hearts out. I think I sang the best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Guess what? I really like
studying the scriptures!
{NEWPAGE}

The monks give us lots
of sweets if we study hard!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My mommy and daddy are at a place
called the far plain.
{NEWPAGE}

I wonder when they're coming home?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sang the Hymn to the monk,
since he was feeling sad.
{NEWPAGE}

He smiled and gave me a
pat on the head.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why are all the monks getting antsy?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We all sang together, so
why isn't {Sin} dead yet?
--------------------------------------------------End--
