Datto
Victory! Victory! We're taking home
that cup, no matter what it takes, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Yaaah!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Haaah!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Arrrgh!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Victory will be ours!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
Should I practice kick passes too?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Yeah.
{CHOICE:31}No, you're fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
Okay, I'll pretend I'm
kicking with my hands!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
Right on!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
I'm gonna sharpen my hand skills!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
I'm so tired of practicing passes.
I wanna do some shooting, too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
He's really bad at kicking.
{NEWPAGE}
Jassu
And I always end up having
to practice with him.
{NEWPAGE}
Jassu
But what can you do, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh? You want to
use the binoculars?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Yes.
{CHOICE:31}No, not really.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No way. Remember what
you did last time?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For both father and daughter
to become summoners--it must
have been {Yevon2}'s will.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If anyone can defeat {Sin}
the daughter of Lord {Braska} can!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please take good care of yourself.
Just remember that your well-being
means a lot to us.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
Man, I wish we were
half as popular as {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
Hey, don't let it get to you.
It's the same as always, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can I have a sphere taken with you?
Or maybe just an autograph?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Someday we'll earn some
respect, just like {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A summoner's confident smile is
always a great encouragement to us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yay!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yahoo! A flying ship!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yippee!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey! Stop that!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just watch what your big
sis is doing and learn!
--------------------------------------------------End--

How long do you think you've been
doing that? Stop it right now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Okay, okay. I see it, so can you
just calm down for a change?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, come down here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you so happy about?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, all right, all right.
Happy, happy! Goody, goody!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why are we so quiet,
all of a sudden?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since that strange shadow
swept across the sky, my little
pet won't come down anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on down!
We don't bite!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wow! I just saw a real flying ship!
I thought I was dreaming again!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, how long are you gonna be
up there? There aren't going to be
any more ships flying by!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {S.S. Liki} is funded
by {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

It doesn't cost a single Gil, even when
I take my dogs on board with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you like dogs?
{NEWPAGE}

I just adore them.
{NEWPAGE}

Good boy. Good boy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's been so nice travelling with
my dog... I wish we could go
on forever.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray that the elders of {Yevon2}
can keep peace in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship's bad news!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ships aren't supposed to fly!
It's frightened my precious dogs!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, you. You were on the ship
when {Sin} attacked us, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've been afraid of the
sea ever since then.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm so afraid it'll come back
I can't even concentrate on my work!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I should probably find a
new job on land somewhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They put me on watch duty, since
I can't handle my old post anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whenever I'm on watch, I keep
thinking that {Sin}'s gonna come
back for us.
{NEWPAGE}

I-I can't stop shaking.
Oh, I'm so pathetic.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought the sea breeze would help
cure {Sin}'s toxin, but no luck so far.
{NEWPAGE}

I keep seeing {Sin} attacking us again.
{NEWPAGE}

I...I just can't seem to get
{Sin} out of my head! Arrgh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't call myself a sailor like this.
Maybe I should leave the ship and go
on a pilgrimage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once {Sin} is defeated, I won't have
to be afraid of the sea anymore.
{NEWPAGE}

I can return to my old seadog self again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I pray for anything, it's
going to be for those guys on
the flying ship to defeat {Sin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I die, I want to have a grand
sending to the {Farplane}.
{NEWPAGE}

Hmm. I'll ask them to reserve the
{Luca Stadium} for the ceremony.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wouldn't mind having a bevy of
young maidens crying their hearts
out for me, either.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, it'll probably be a long time
before I'm sent to the {Farplane}, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whatever came of that rumor about
the high summoner's daughter
marrying the lord maester?
{NEWPAGE}

Hmm, so it was called off, huh?
Too bad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Every story you hear
lately is so depressing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the {Calm} comes, we'll be
able to truly enjoy blitzball.
{NEWPAGE}

Dangit. Maybe I retired too soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the greatest champions
must retire sometime. The same
must be true of {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I brought these children along
to teach them how to become
merchants, but all they do is play!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once little kids learn something fun,
they just repeat it over and over.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The kids found a new way to play.
They'll never be merchants now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think so too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't give me such nonsense.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just watching those two
made me a little envious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you know that the
warrior monks raided {Besaid Island}?
{NEWPAGE}

They said they were
searching for traitors.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Besaid} refused
to tell them anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sang at the top of my lungs
when I saw the flying ship...
{NEWPAGE}

But I wonder if singing in the
middle of the ocean did any good?
--------------------------------------------------End--

All we can do now is
pray for {Sin} to go away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My husband used to be a pro
blitzer, and I was his goalie.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whether in a tournament or in
life, we're the best partners.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My husband was the best
blitzer in the league.
{NEWPAGE}

Even Bickson of the {Luca Goers} wouldn't
have stood a chance against him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seems like there was trouble
in {Bevelle}. Oh dear,
I wonder what has happened?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My husband used to be a blitzer.
He kept playing right into his golden years!
{NEWPAGE}

But he could take down blitzers
only half his age. It's true!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was one of those young blitzers once...
I'll leave the rest up to your imagination!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ever since {Sin} got to him, my partner
has turned into a gutless wonder.
{NEWPAGE}

He used to be so dependable, but now he just
stares into the sea with terror in his eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s toxin probably got to him.
{NEWPAGE}

I hope the cool sea breeze
cures him soon...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ever since {Sin} attacked us, my
shipmate has been terrified of the sea.
{NEWPAGE}

I can't believe it. I mean, he's lived
by the sea since he was a kid...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s toxin turned
him into a coward.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He's perked up a little seeing
that flying ship battling {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

Once {Sin} is gone, he'll
probably get back to normal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank god for that flying ship.
Now that's the blessing of {Yevon2}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Go ahead and rest down below.
We'll be there by the time you wake up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Word is that summoner's
got noble blood!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard she's Lord {Braska}'s daughter!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ya don't say?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Lord {Braska}'s...daughter?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Braska}'s daughter?
She just might have a chance!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll get her to {Kilika}, we will!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
She does have a name,
you know... {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm? Lady {Yuna}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well then, we pray for
Lady {Yuna}'s safe passage!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Come to think of it, I haven't
told you where we're going!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
First to {Blue}{Kilika}{White} Island, then we
change boats and head for Luca.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
'Fore that, though, {Yuna}'s gotta
pray at the temple. I'll be guarding.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
We'll be praying for the {Aurochs}'
victory, too, so you come along, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Great plan.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Hey, it is a great plan!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Don't look at me!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So, is {Yuna}'s father
famous or something?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
She's the daughter of
{High Summoner Braska}!
You saw his statue at the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Lord {Braska} defeated {Sin} ten years ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
{Yuna}'s the heir to a great legacy!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It's tough when
your father's famous.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Wakka}'s...a bit lacking
in the imagination department.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Thanks, {Lulu},
I'll keep that in mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Oh yeah, you talk to {Yuna} yet?
She had some questions for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
I don't know who you are,
or where you came from.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
If you interfere with {Yuna}'s
pilgrimage, we won't take it lightly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Nice to see you again!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You! You really
quit the knights?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Yeah, I did.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
{Elma} was upset with me,
but Captain {Lucil} understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Now, I'm working as a
chocobo breeder on this ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
I really, really love
taking care of chocobos!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Being with chocobos all the time...
I think I've found my calling!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
And it's all thanks
to you! Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Well, I'm happy for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Oh, yeah!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
I found this in one of the
chocobo nests the other day.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
It's no use to me, so
I want you to have it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Ah, I have to go now.
It's time for lunch.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Hey, I want to talk to you some more.
Can't your stomach wait?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
I meant I have to feed the chocobos.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
They get really upset
if they're not fed!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
See you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, can you believe this!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}What?
{CHOICE:31}No, bye.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just saw this merchant guy
inside the ship, and guess
what he said to me?
{NEWPAGE}

He walked up to me and said,
"You're no good!" Just like that!
{NEWPAGE}

Isn't that awful?
I've still got style! I'll show him!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't you think so, too?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Yeah.
{CHOICE:31}Well...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's right. I knew I was right.
He doesn't know what he's talking about!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You men are all alike!
Get away from me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You could at least
pretend to listen!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It makes me so mad.
I'm not going inside anymore!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if they're related?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}I'd say they're related.
{CHOICE:31}Looks like they're married.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Going to rest now?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Not yet.
{CHOICE:31}Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{AREA}
Besaid
--------------------------------------------------End--
{AREA}
Kilika Port
--------------------------------------------------End--
