This is the {Temple of Yevon-Djose}.
It is famous for its association with
Lord {Mi'ihen}, founder of the {Crusader}s.

Had he witnessed this dreadful sight...
Oh, I could just imagine his grief.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is a quiet morning.
{NEWPAGE}

Many {Crusader}s departed
for the {Farplane} last night.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester {Mika} carried {Spira}
on his shoulders for fifty years.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm sure he is resting peacefully
on the {Farplane} now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder who the next grand maester will be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In my youth, I trained with Maester {Jyscal}.
{NEWPAGE}

We rose above our differences and
became friends, human and {Guado}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're all out of healing potions.
{NEWPAGE}

Even so, more wounded men
are being brought here.

{WINDOW}
{Yellow}Blitz Fan Lv. 1{White}
Name: Sonio
Favorite team: {Kilika Beasts}
He appears to be just an ordinary fan.
You cannot sign him to a contract.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I solemnly pray Lady {Yuna} will become a
wonderful summoner. Please take care of her.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lady {Yuna} performed the sending all night.
{NEWPAGE}

I imagine it must have been quite
hard on such a young summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My fellow monks have left the temple.
{NEWPAGE}

They said that nothing will change so long
as we remain within these confines.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I cannot say they are right or wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We plan to station warrior monks in
various locales to prepare for a
possible raid by fiends and {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Captain, please! Wake up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You were the best, Captain!
We'll never forget you!
