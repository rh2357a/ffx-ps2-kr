D-Did you beat them?
I was so scared I couldn't move!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ferry docked here is
headed for {Blue}{Kilika Port}{White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Blue}Dock number 3{White} lies straight ahead.
{Blue}Dock number 1{White} lies in the opposite direction.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you've sailed the seas of {Spira}
long enough, little surprises you anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sorry, sir, but the ferry
will remain at anchor for a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This ferry will take you to {Blue}{Kilika}{White}.
Would you like to board?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Yeah, I'd like to board.
{CHOICE:31}No, thanks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We can leave any time you're ready.
You have everything you need?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Yes.
{CHOICE:31}Hold on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Give me a holler when you're ready.
Then we'll set sail for {Kilika}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey, outta my way!
I'm tryin' to work here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, move it!
The ship's clearing out soon!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Al Bhed} machina don't scare me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't survive the seas of {Spira}
getting freaked out by that!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Move it! Outta my way!
I'm busy sorting the cargo!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whenever guard duty gets boring,
I try to remember how much the
{Crusader}s need me right now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're standing guard to keep any
suspicious characters from boarding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the warrior monks gone, it's
up to us {Crusader}s to defend {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Warrior monks are not tour guides!
Don't bother us with your small talk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nothing out of the ordinary, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to be a sailor and sail
all over {Spira} when I grow up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Big boats, small boats,
gotta love 'em all!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sis once got caught trying
to sneak onto that ferry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Take it easy, sis!
You're too obsessed with ships.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I tell her how dangerous it is out
on the ocean, but she never listens.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My granddaughter wants to be
a sailor when she grows up.
What a dreadful thought!
