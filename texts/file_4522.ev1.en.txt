When {Sin} attacked {Zanarkand}
that day, I woke up in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I kept hoping it would
work in reverse, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I will defeat {Sin}...
I must defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was just fooling myself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe it was that day...
on the sea, under the burning sun.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I started to give up hope.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was in a foreign world.
I wasn't going home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This was my new reality,
and I was stuck in it for good.
--------------------------------------------------End--
