{Wakka}
{Besaid} Village.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
They got any food there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
We'll get you something over there
later. Take a look around first.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Let's see...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
The {Crusader}s Lodge is over yonder.
{Luzzu} and {Gatta} are usually there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Oh, right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Over here!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Huh? What's up?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
You do remember the prayer, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}I don't remember.
{CHOICE:31}I don't know any prayers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I didn't know it in the first
place, to tell the truth.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Man, that's like the basics of the
basics. Alright, I'll show you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Go ahead, you try.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Hey, not bad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Okay, now go present yourself
to the temple summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Any {blitzball} player would
know that prayer. It was the
{blitzball} sign for victory. 
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course I'd never prayed
before in my life. Not that
he would know that...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
You...must have forgot or
something. Here, I'll show you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Go ahead, you try.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Hey, not bad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're the guy from the sea, right?
I heard about you from Sir {Luzzu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{High Summoner Gandof}, give us your
blessing, and watch over my family.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm getting ready to go out fishing.
There's fiends out in the sea, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you saying? You would
break the precepts, fool child?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pray with daddy for
the summoner, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You should pray for the
apprentice summoner's safety, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You might think about not
having that toxin cured.
{NEWPAGE}

I know there's lots of things
I'd like to forget. Lots.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know why the temple faces
away from the sea?
{NEWPAGE}

So it does not have to look upon
the sea from which {Sin} comes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm heading out fishing, so I'm
praying for a {Sin}less ocean.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm getting ready to go out fishing.
There's fiends out in the sea, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs} put up a great fight this year.
{Wakka}'s the best, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It may not be much help to Lady {Yuna},
but allow me to pray for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I know {Sin}'s out there, but if I
don't go out, my family won't eat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear you're traitors, now?
Who's responsible for that nonsense?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When will Lady {Yuna}'s
Calm come to Spira...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple's so busy chasing
traitors they've left {Sin} alone.
{NEWPAGE}

It will be a long time yet before
I can feel safe going out to sea.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be out to sea soon. Perhaps I'll
be greeting the Calm from deck.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was pulling in my catch when
{Sin} and the flying ship went by.
{NEWPAGE}

What a sight!
I think I forgot to sing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm praying for the blessings of {Yevon2}
to guide that flying ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Odd clothes you got. What land you from?
This your first time to {Besaid}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We don't get many strangers here.
I remember every visitor we get.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone's gone to the temple, but
I'm more comfortable praying at home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And what if something happened?
I'd be afraid to go see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At last, Lady {Yuna} has become
a true summoner like her father!
{NEWPAGE}

She was so small when she first
came to {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am sure Lady {Yuna} will become a high
summoner. Everyone in {Besaid} thinks so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard the {Crusader}s' operation failed.
Maybe {Luzzu} and {Gatta} will repent and come home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've no desire to go against the
teachings, but something's not right
with the temple these days.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Daddy doesn't play
with me at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't figure whether I'm gonna join
the {Aurochs} or the Crusaders!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm pretty good at blitz, ya?
I can hold my breath and everything!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say I gotta train in order
to join the Crusaders...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Me and Sir {Luzzu} and {Gatta} will
beat {Sin}, just the three of us!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dad, come on!
Let's go help!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's go help the summoner!
I promise I'll be a good boy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

A summoner came to this village not
long ago. Now what was his name?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like you got
over the toxin, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sir {Luzzu} and the others aren't back.
What could have happened?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is true Lady {Yuna}'s a traitor?
No one here believes that at all!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We got letters from the {Aurochs}!
They're doing great in {Luca}, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if {Sin} is really
going to go away?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Long as I'm around, {Besaid}'s weaving
will be known as nothing but the best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't you worry. The summoner will
return, I know it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Worrying over a few hours delay
is nothing but a lack of faith!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even should {Sin} come tomorrow,
life is the same today.
{NEWPAGE}

We live and we work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who cares who they're calling traitor.
Defeat {Sin}, and it'll all be forgotten!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wait for the Calm to come before rejoicing.
Wouldn't want any...false hope.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am sure that Lord {Braska} is
watching over our apprentice summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On a hot day like today,
it's best to be in the shade, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wove so much last month. All lost
when {Sin} destroyed my boat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You the one they say
came from the sea?
{NEWPAGE}

Toxin's still got you, ya?
You go ahead and rest up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Gone for a night and a day now.
I'm too worried to speak!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Though I'm sure nothing bad is
happening. Not to that summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm glad the ferry's on its way,
but {Sin} will be back, he will.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've heard that the {Crusader}s that
fought {Sin} were defeated!
{NEWPAGE}

What terrible news! It's because
they turned their backs on the teachings!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When those children calling themselves
{Crusader}s come back, they're in for a scolding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All these warrior monks were here
looking for Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Lady {Yuna} defeats {Sin} I'm sure
those nasty rumors will go away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder who was riding
on that ship in the sky?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone in the village is
all excited about that flying ship.
{NEWPAGE}

Heck, I bet all
of {Spira}'s worked up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you! Come again!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why isn't the apprentice
summoner back yet?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're going with Lady {Yuna}?
Does that mean you're a guardian?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}No way.
{CHOICE:31}Maybe so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're saving it for the tournament then!
The {Aurochs} have got to win this year!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If there's anything you need
to know about guardians, ask {Lulu}.
{NEWPAGE}

{Lulu} knows everything. She'll be a
bigger help than {Wakka} for sure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope your toxin wears off soon.
{NEWPAGE}

I'll sneak in a prayer for you
when I pray for Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're the talk of the town, you know?
Word travels fast in a village this size.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the {Aurochs} don't lose
their first match again.
{NEWPAGE}

I'd like to see them at least
tie a game one of these years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure everything's fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say that again.
Please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The apprentice hasn't returned.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Huh? Apprentice?
{CHOICE:31}Hasn't returned from where?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The apprentice is the apprentice!
The apprentice summoner, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Cloister of Trials!
It's been a day already.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yevon be with us...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm watching the store while
sis is off praying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Buy more!
Support the local economy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come back soon!
{NEWPAGE}

You know a funny thing happened.
{NEWPAGE}

My dog dug something up
yesterday. I wonder what it was.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe {Wakka}'s
leaving the team.
{NEWPAGE}

With you and {Wakka} there, the {Aurochs}
would have the winning streak of the century!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if we'll get more customers
now that the ferry's up and running again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those monks looking for Lady {Yuna} said
that only traitors harbor traitors!
{NEWPAGE}

Can you believe it? And they're the
ones guarding the temples?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs} are still in {Luca}, ya?
You should pay 'em a visit sometime.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to the flying ship?
I hope it made it through the fight.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just between me and you, I hear that
there's no maesters left anymore!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, have this.
This little fella brought it.
{NEWPAGE}

I can't figure what it is either.
You go ahead and take a look.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who are you, mister?
Where you from?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The apprentice entered the trials,
and hasn't come back...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure Lady {Yuna} will have
lots of stories when she gets back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Another summoner came here by boat.
He was a nice guy.
{NEWPAGE}

But I like Lady {Yuna} much better!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the Calm comes, Lady {Yuna}
has to come back so we can celebrate!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's a trader? I asked the
monk, but he won't tell me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If that flying ship comes back
I'm gonna sing real loud!
--------------------------------------------------End--

He's got something in his mouth.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Obtained {Yellow}something
mangled and slobbery{White}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fiends are around even during the day.
Take care not to travel alone, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know it's too dangerous.
Sorry, but you can't pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the apprentice is well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Instead of just loafing around
you should be praying, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sir {Luzzu} and his troops are on a mission.
I'm on watch duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Really, it should've been {Gatta} on watch,
but he made them take him along, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

I guess new recruits are always eager,
but this ain't no training mission.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Like to take a rest?
Got to keep sharp, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}I'd like a nap.
{CHOICE:31}Maybe later.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to the ones we fought during
the operation, {Besaid} fiends are easy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I did my time in battle!
Fiends are no problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship looked like an {Al Bhed}
machina to me. Hope it works this time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Crusaders Lodge is open
to guests. Take a rest?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to go to the temple, but
there's an operation to prepare for.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} and the others
are waiting outside!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I had a run-in with {Sin}'s
toxin before too, you know?
{NEWPAGE}

I'm a lot better now, but
things were pretty bad for a while.
{NEWPAGE}

Couldn't remember who I was or
where I came from! Scary, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

Man, I nearly cried,
and that's the truth!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got better, but only after
praying at the temple a lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You should try praying. It worked
for me--it'll work for you, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope I get over the toxin quick.
The big operation's coming up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You looking for {Wakka}? The priest
called him to the temple a while back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I haven't fully healed from {Sin}'s
toxin so I'm on guard detail.
{NEWPAGE}

Don't get me wrong, I'd rather be
with my buddies.
{NEWPAGE}

But I'm a little relieved. This
operation's gonna be dangerous, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You should try praying. It worked
for me--it'll work for you, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm praying for Sir {Luzzu}'s and the others'
safety. Yevon knows they'll need it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course, with the {Crusader}s excommunicated,
I'm not supposed to be in the temple.
{NEWPAGE}

But the priest let me in special.
Guess he's not all precepts after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just a bunch of empty beds
without people to sleep in them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe {Operation Mi'ihen}
was a failure. I just can't.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just pray everyone makes
it back okay. Please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Praying won't keep fiends away.
It takes {Crusader}s to defend {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The toxin finally wore off. Now to
make up for all my downtime, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The battle with {Sin} ain't over yet...
I wish there was something we could do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm fixing a hole where the
rain gets in.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rent's free, but I've been working
like a dog just fixing the place.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s struck {Besaid} Village
so many times I lost count.
{NEWPAGE}

After this house got hit I guess
the owner just let it be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} will just come back and
destroy it again. Sometimes
I wonder why I bother.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He looks pretty weak.
Maybe he just can't take it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I guess I'll just keep fixing the leaks
until the {Crusader}s get back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s sure try hard,
but I don't think they got what
it takes to beat {Sin}, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sir {Luzzu} and {Gatta} aren't back yet.
What if they died in battle?
{NEWPAGE}

Or maybe they're just so ashamed
they don't want to come home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seems the fiends have increased
with the {Crusader}s gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm no fiend-fighter, so I fix things
and help the {Crusader}s that way.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sir {Luzzu} won't admit it,
but he's really down.
{NEWPAGE}

I think he feels guilty about
{Gatta} dying, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sir {Gatta} was gloomy as ever after
he returned from the operation.
{NEWPAGE}

Thankfully, his new post as leader
of the {Besaid} {Crusader}s seems to
have lifted his spirits.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard the {Sin} toxin got to you.
Took your memory, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'd be happy to teach you anything
you've forgotten, sonny.

Something else you'd
like to know, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How could you forget {Sin}?
I can't say I don't envy you, though.
{NEWPAGE}

There's many who would give anything
to forget the pain {Sin} has brought.
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} appeared a thousand years ago,
a raging demon intent on reducing {Spira}
to rubble.
{NEWPAGE}

Everyone in {Spira} lives
under {Sin}'s black shadow.
{NEWPAGE}

But to forget {Sin}...well,
I'd consider yourself lucky, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} appeared one thousand years ago,

But to forget {Sin}...well,
I'd consider yourself lucky, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The foul vapors that boil from
{Sin}'s hide are evil indeed...
{NEWPAGE}

One breath, and it will taint
the very core of your body.
{NEWPAGE}

People who get too close to {Sin} forget
even the most important things.
{NEWPAGE}

Just like you, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How wretched you must be, to have
forgotten the teachings of {Yevon2}!
{NEWPAGE}

The teachings are the only salvation
for those who suffer because of {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm sure you followed the teachings,
before the toxin got to you, of course.
{NEWPAGE}

Go pray at the temple,
and all will return in time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Zanarkand was once a great city
in the far north of this land.
{NEWPAGE}

Now it lies in ruin, destroyed
by {Sin} a thousand years ago.
{NEWPAGE}

Such was its punishment for
relying too much on machina.
--------------------------------------------------End--

One of the four summoners that
fought {Sin} in the past.
{NEWPAGE}

Lord {Ohalland}, Lord {Gandof},
Lady {Yocun} and Lord {Braska}, it was.
{NEWPAGE}

{Spira} would have fallen to {Sin} long ago
if the high summoners weren't around!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry I can't do more to help.
You understand, eh, sonny?
{NEWPAGE}

The whole village's all wound up, with
the apprentice not back from the trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All this worrying's no good
for an old man like myself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure you'd like to know
more before you head out, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some wild youngsters are saying
the {Aurochs} won after a 23-year
losing streak!
{NEWPAGE}

Yeah, well that'll be the day!
{Aurochs} winning? Heh! Heheheh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like you got over the toxin.
Praise be to {Yevon2}, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We {Besaid}ers all know
Lady {Yuna}'s no traitor.
{NEWPAGE}

The daughter of Lord {Braska}
turning against Yevon? Hogwash!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We simple folk ain't got a clue
what them temple elders are thinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think I'll stick around long enough to
see {Sin} get what's coming to it! Heh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Me favorite's Lord Ohalland, ya?
Spitting image of me old hubby.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With Lord {Braska} looking over her,
I'm sure she'll be returning, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What do you want, heathen?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've nothing to say to a
breaker of the precepts!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not disturb our
prayers, heathen!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? You? A guardian?
The toxin still got you, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What trick have you pulled
on the good Lady {Yuna}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I made up me mind to pray every
day till Lady {Yuna}'s Calm begins.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the Calm comes, we'll be putting
up a statue of a new high summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sin's toxin?
Nah, you don't look sick.
{NEWPAGE}

You must have not breathed in
much of the stuff, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

Guess being a blitz player means you
can hold your breath pretty good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanted to be a blitzer way back when.
I just couldn't hold my breath.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mainlanders love the fabrics
we weave here in {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I suppose you can't run a
business on tradition alone, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village was attacked by {Sin}
when I was just a little kid, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

The village was burnt to ashes...
I still have nightmares of that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got a bad feeling, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, the last summoner
almost...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, my apologies.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Without breaking the precepts,
all we can do is pray, ya?

I heard {Kilika} was attacked, ya?
Wh-What if {Besaid}'s next?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm so scared of {Sin} I can't
think straight, but the old man
will have my hide if I mess up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I bet me praying every day helped
the {Aurochs} finally win, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a reward being offered
for news of the traitors.
{NEWPAGE}

No one here'd think of saying
nothing, but watch out on the road.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how things are on the mainland.
We don't get much news down here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sounds like that poppycock about
Lady {Yuna} finally got cleared up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now if {Sin}'d just go away,
we'd have nothing to worry about.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's hard to work with the
Calm right around the corner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the apprentice summoner
return to us safely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yevon2}'s teachings are our
staff and our guide in life.
{NEWPAGE}

Without the teachings, we'd just
live every day in fear of {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It...It's like we were
born to live in fear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the protection of {Yevon2}
be with our apprentice.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, guide Lady {Yuna}'s
travels well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I think about Lady {Yuna}'s
journey, I wonder if praying is enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure she'll be fine.
{Lulu}'s with her and all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the machina's fault that so
many of our {Crusader}s died.
{NEWPAGE}

So many lives wasted...
and for what gain?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You should watch yourself.
Never go against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How unfortunate that Lady {Yuna}'s
engagement to {Master Seymor}
was put off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe Lady {Yuna} would ever
turn her back to the teachings! Never!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray that the next Calm
will last a long time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please let the Aurochs
score at least one goal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka}'s a guardian.
He should go help.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm gonna pray for
Lady {Yuna} every day!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I was born, Lord {Braska} and
two guardians came to our village.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let Lady {Yuna} defeat {Sin}...
Soon...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The priest told me the story of
Lady {Yunalesca} and Lord {Zaon}.

If I was strong like Lord {Zaon}
I could have been a guardian, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only sworn guardians may
approach the Cloister of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pray hard, and the toxin will
surely release its grip on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The high summoners, in order from
the right: Lord {Braska}, Lady Yocun...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord Ohalland, and Lord Gandof.
Do you remember them now?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Putting your transgression aside
for now, let us celebrate the birth
of a summoner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Quickly, to the village square!
Share in our joy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Perhaps your transgression shall
be pardoned on account of the toxin.
{NEWPAGE}

But just this once.
Follow the teachings, my son.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are planning an operation
that defies the teachings of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

It is a pity. The loss of {Chappu} should
be lesson enough to follow the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You look better than you did yesterday.
Has {Sin}'s toxin weakened its grip?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The summoner undergoes the trials.
We must not interfere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've not told the people yet, but I
hear {Maester Mika2} has passed away.
{NEWPAGE}

What is going on in {Bevelle}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The chaos in the temple only
serves to worry the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This ship of the air, could it
be an {Al Bhed} machina?
{NEWPAGE}

I'm not sure whether to
cheer or condemn it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even searching the Scriptures of {Yevon2},
I have found no cure for {Sin}'s toxin.
{NEWPAGE}

May the blessing of {Yevon2}
guide you to health, friend.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I, too, will pray for the
blessing of {Yevon2} to shine upon you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My heart is heavy when I think
of the worst that could happen.
{NEWPAGE}

Should the Trials remain unconquered,
our apprentice has no future.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Great strength is only obtained
through great suffering.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let us greet the {Crusader}s
warmly when they arrive.
{NEWPAGE}

Returning them to the true path
is my duty as a follower of Yevon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It appears the summoner's pilgrimage
goes well! Very good, very good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All word from {St. Bevelle}
has ceased.
{NEWPAGE}

None of the temples know
which way to turn.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You've been a stranger to
the temples lately, I hear.
{NEWPAGE}

Be at peace. Come what may, you
are always welcome at our temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the teachings of a thousand years
are due for an update once in a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why, if {Sin} is defeated, we may
no longer need {Yevon2}'s guidance.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Besaid}'s devotion to the teachings
of {Yevon2} is commendable.
{NEWPAGE}

Still, there is much for a priestess
such as I to teach them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I appreciate the {Crusader}s' zeal,
but they must heed the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the statues' guidance, I'm
sure our apprentice is doing fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pray at the temple, and you may
just overcome {Sin}'s toxin.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't mean to be rude, but
some privacy would be appreciated.
{NEWPAGE}

I must pray for our apprentice
summoner, you understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of the village could use
your help. You should pray, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I suppose we'll have to call our
apprentice Lady {Yuna} now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And you, heathen. Know that the
teachings are the only true guide!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The summoner embarks on a perilous
pilgrimage to save the people.
{NEWPAGE}

We must pray from the very
bottom of our hearts for her success.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fear not! The toxin will heal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I appreciate the {Crusader}s' zeal,
but they must heed the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of the island all pray
for Lady {Yuna}'s safety.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm doing my part, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Word of Lady {Yuna}'s achievements
has reached this island, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear you've become a guardian!
May you guard Lady {Yuna} well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even here in {Besaid} we've got
orders to arrest Lady {Yuna}.
{NEWPAGE}

Nobody knows what to do, but we
certainly wouldn't do THAT!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those warrior monks that came to the
island were just a bunch of crooks, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who can the people of {Yevon2} turn
to now that {Maester Mika2} is gone?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've followed the teachings of {Yevon2}
ever since I was a child.
{NEWPAGE}

Even should the temple fall,
I will keep praying. I will.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid} fabrics they make
here are famous all over Spira!
{NEWPAGE}

If I buy cheap and sell high,
I'll be rolling in Gil in no time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Take a look. Even with the village
in turmoil, they just weave away.
{NEWPAGE}

Now that's the true sign
of a professional!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, I'm worried too!
But all we can do is wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That old coot dropped what he was
doing to go see the summoner off.
{NEWPAGE}

Now I gotta do all his work, too!
It's just not fair.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry, no time to talk.
Rover starts barking when I slack off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

One recruit ain't gonna make
the {Aurochs} winners!
{NEWPAGE}

They'll lose in the first round
again, leaving us {Luca Goers} to
pick up the cup!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the {Crusader}s' operation goes
right against the teachings of {Yevon2}!
{NEWPAGE}

They're way out of their league, if
you ask me. Leave {Sin} to the summoners!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard you whooped 'em good
at the tournament in {Luca}!
{NEWPAGE}

Maybe the {Aurochs}' winning will
be good for the weaving business, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Heard the {Crusader}s got their butts
kicked. They had it coming, if you ask me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure impressed
with the old man, ya?
{NEWPAGE}

If {Sin} showed up, I bet he'd stare
it in the eye and just keep on working!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, if it ain't the traitors!
You got some nerve coming here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey, just kidding!
No need to glare, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear things at the temples are a mess.
Bad for business, I tell you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll admit it, I didn't believe that story
about the flying ship! Who would?
{NEWPAGE}

When it came flying over town,
whoowee! I nearly up and died.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When that ship came, the old man,
he kept working while he sang!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I travelled Spira looking for a land
where nobody had heard of {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

I...I gave up looking.
I think it's for the best.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village where I was born is
no longer there, thanks to {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The villagers have a lot on their minds.
You should stay quiet for a while.
{NEWPAGE}

Intoxication is no excuse for
bothering people with questions.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Most of the villagers went down
to say farewell at the dock.
{NEWPAGE}

Our summoner's leaving.
Aw, I've never liked goodbyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Careful not to break any more precepts,
or you'll end up like the {Crusader}s!
--------------------------------------------------End--

A summoner named Lord {Isaaru} came
to the village, but he left so soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s' operation failed
as expected, because they used machina!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Operation Mi'ihen} was a crushing loss
for the {Crusader}s, but they're
rallying together from every land.
{NEWPAGE}

Much better than those warrior monks.
They're all holed up in {Bevelle}, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's funny that the {Crusader}s are
the ones protecting us, even after
being excommunicated.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe I should learn {Besaid}
weaving...make a place for myself here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I doubt some old song is going
to help anyone beat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seafaring is hard work. Gotta kick
back sometimes. Get some R & R, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that {Sin}
showed up near here?
{NEWPAGE}

Oh boy! And the S.S. Liki's
scheduled to leave any day now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sure hope we don't run into
{Sin} on our next voyage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw the apprentice summoner and two
guardians enter the temple yesterday.
{NEWPAGE}

Everything looked alright then.
But now I'm starting to worry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I do hope they come back safely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm gonna kick back in town
till the next ship gets here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no time to rest out there.
Never know when {Sin} will show up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you muck around here,
the ship will leave without you!
{NEWPAGE}

And the next boat won't be here
for a while. Better hurry, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I really, really hope we don't
run into {Sin} on this voyage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Someone saw an {Al Bhed}
ship near the island.
{NEWPAGE}

Wonder what they're up
to in these waters?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I kinda got to liking this town.
Maybe I'll give up seafaring.
--------------------------------------------------End--

One of my friends is on your ship.
I'll pray for both of you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard the {Guado} blew up
the {Al Bhed}'s home!
{NEWPAGE}

I got no love for the {Al Bhed},
but that's going too far.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No matter what happens in the
temples, it's life as usual here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seems kind of odd to pray
for the temples' sake, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship was spectacular!
Those {Al Bhed} might have something there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
