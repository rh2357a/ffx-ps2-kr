{CHOICE:30}Got any armor?
{CHOICE:31}Got any items?
{CHOICE:32}Leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Feel free to stop by anytime.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, there. If you don't buy anything
from me, you'll regret it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dangerous when shoopuf's close.
Wants to be shmooshed?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't touch shoopuf.
Tailss will be shlapping!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Shing the Hymn?
A very, very myshterious shong indeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Shoopuf happy now shince
ebullibody shing shong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There have been reports of
{Al Bhed} sightings in this area.
{NEWPAGE}

Stay alert and keep
your guard up at all times!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Al Bhed} have green eyes with a swirl
pattern. Report any sightings immediately!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Al Bhed} are roaming this area,
targeting summoners.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please rest assured,
the shoopuf is operating as usual.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With Yevon in chaos,
the {Crusader}s must be vigilant.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The fight against {Sin} continues.
Be careful when heading north.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Riding the shoopuf is free
because the temple pays for it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple provides for the people.
We are truly blessed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems that Maester {Seymor}
will be marrying Lord {Braska}'s daughter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With their combined strength,
Yevon will prosper.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are we to do now that the
warrior monks are up and gone?
{NEWPAGE}

I'm sure the temple has a plan, but
Yevon works in strange ways, it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Me? I obey the temple, without question.
Who would ever shun the sacred temple?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I tried singing the Hymn although I
didn't know what significance it had.
{NEWPAGE}

There was nothing else to do.
In times of need, people will try anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The high priests and the
summoners will take care of us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You say our machina violate
the teachings, eh? Nonsense!
--------------------------------------------------End--

These machina have Yevon's approval. Don't
mix them up with the forbidden ones, got it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The maester's engagement is such a
blessing. It lightens even my spirits.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Uh, what happened to Maester {Seymor}
and Lady {Yuna}'s marriage?
{NEWPAGE}

I heard the maester disappeared from
{Bevelle}, and {Yuna} is now a traitor!
Unbelievable!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Careful what you believe, especially
when such nonsense is floatin' around.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought that flying ship was
Yevon's secret weapon...
{NEWPAGE}

but now they're sayin' that
{Al Bhed} are at the helm!
{NEWPAGE}

You tellin' me that the temple
and the {Al Bhed} have joined forces?
Rubbish!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't believe anything anymore!
Just pray that {Sin} will go away.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Ten years ago...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
A history lesson?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} saw his first shoopuf here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Surprised, he drew
his blade and struck it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
He was drunk...
Thought it was a fiend.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Oh, brother...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
We offered all the money
we had as an apology.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} never drank again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
But, it would seem
that shoopuf still works here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Even after ten years,
{Spira} hasn't changed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Truly...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
The place seems to resist change.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It would take something unusual.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Don't let the peaceful scenery fool you.
Be on guard at all times.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Driver
Ride ze shoopuf?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Driver
Shoopuf's waiting!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Driver
All aboards!
--------------------------------------------------End--
