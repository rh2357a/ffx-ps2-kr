{Tidus}
{Rikku}!
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Blitzball!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey!
You okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Heeey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whoa-ho!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Yo! Hiya!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You wanna try that
move one more time?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Finally, things were
starting to look up.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--

You're no amateur.
Who you play for?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
The {Zanarkand Abes}!
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--

What team you say again?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Uh, I meant...
Forget that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I got too, uh...close to {Sin}
and my head's all foggy-like.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So I don't know where this place is.
Or even where I came from.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s toxin got to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But, you're still alive.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Praise be to {Yevon2}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

All right, back to practice!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm {Wakka}, coach and captain
of the {Besaid Aurochs}, brudda.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
What?
You hungry?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Okay! Back to the village.
I'll get you somethin'!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I felt like I could trust this
{Wakka}, so I just had to ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Long time ago, there were a whole
lot of cities in {Spira}. Big cities
with machina--machines--to run 'em.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
People played all day and
let the machina do the work.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
And then, well, take a look.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
{Sin} came, and destroyed
the machina cities.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
And {Zanarkand} along with 'em.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Yeah, that was about a thousand
years ago, just like you said.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
If you ask me, {Sin}'s our punishment
for letting things get out of hand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
What gets me, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
is we gotta suffer, 'cause of what
some goofballs did way back when!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
'Course, we must always repent
for our sins! That's important!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
It's just that, it's hard to
keep at it sometimes, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was just as {Rikku} said.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} and {Rikku} couldn't both
be lying. Why would they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

          
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
But you from the {Zanarkand Abes}--
that was a good one!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I appreciated the fact that
{Wakka} was trying to cheer me up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But at that time, all
I could think about was...
--------------------------------------------------End--

everything that happened to
me--all this--started with {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe if I could find {Sin}
one more time, I could go home!
--------------------------------------------------End--

For now, I'd just live life until
that time came. No more worrying
about where, or when, I was.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sure it was hard not to think of home.
But I started to feel better already.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A little better...maybe.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
I gotta stop closing my eyes
when the ball comes down.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
That toxin's nasty stuff, ya?
You should go rest up.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
What am I saying?
Take this, it might help!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
You being a blitzball player's
probably what saved you out there.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto
The best players--they can
hold their breath, like, forever!
{NEWPAGE}
Datto
I wish I could do that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
We had an underwater race once, ya?
To see how long we could go.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto
Two laps and we were out, but 
Cap'n {Wakka} went five, no sweat!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
I can head the ball pretty good.
Today's just a bad day, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
This is really weird, ya?
I could do five in a row yesterday!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
I'm nowhere near Cap'n {Wakka},
but I can hold my own underwater, ya?
{NEWPAGE}
Letty
It's just that...
I'm not so good with the ball.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
It true that the best players
can even sleep underwater?
{NEWPAGE}
Letty
Man, that's like...superhuman, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
That shot was spectacular, brudda!
Wish I could shoot like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
Cap'n {Wakka}'s waiting for you.
You better get going, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jassu
There's fiends on the road, ya?
Use this if you get in trouble.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Botta
I really want to make Cap'n {Wakka}
proud at this year's tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Botta
Come practice with us once
the toxin wears off, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Botta
Hope you get better soon, brudda.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Keepa
Hey, I'll admit it. We're
not the best blitzers in Spira.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Keepa
"To do our best!" That's our motto.
Guess it's not enough, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Keepa
Here, take this.
And do your best, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Keepa
We're always top dogs for the
first few minutes of the game, ya?
{NEWPAGE}
Keepa
Then we start to run out of breath.
That's when they get us.
{NEWPAGE}
Keepa
But Cap'n {Wakka}, man,
he don't stop!
{NEWPAGE}
Keepa
No halftime breath for him, ya?
He just keeps going!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Hey, I'm not saying the
team never existed, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
But you gotta figure a team livin' in
luxury like that'd be pretty soft, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It's true {Zanarkand} was destroyed,
right? A thousand years ago?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
So it's just a big pile
of rubble now, isn't it?
