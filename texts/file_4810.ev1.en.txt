Lord {Braska} must be bursting with
pride up on the {Farplane}
at having such a fine daughter!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard the {Al Bhed} attacked you!
Are you okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope to celebrate Lady {Yuna}'s
Calm while I'm still alive.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about seeing Lord {Braska}
in {Guadosalam}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

With a summoner like you at our side,
we've no need to fear {Sin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll have great stories to tell
about meeting Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Never even crossed my mind that Lady {Yuna}
would marry... Now that's a great story to tell!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know that machina that lifts you up
to the shoopuf? I don't like it, I tell you.
{NEWPAGE}

I don't care if it's been approved by the temple.
Machina is machina. That's that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even sanctioned machina gives
me the creeps, I tell you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I tell you, my wife was as pretty as
Lady {Yuna} back in her day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Lady {Yuna} gets married, will
she abandon her quest to vanquish {Sin}?
{NEWPAGE}

That is what worries me the most.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm afraid I'll be attacked
by {Al Bhed} if I travel alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think the temple should crack down
on the {Al Bhed} and teach them a lesson or two!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Have you seen the {Crusader}s returning home?
They look pathetic.
{NEWPAGE}

And they were so confident
the last time they passed through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It should be a big ceremony because
a maester's getting married.
{NEWPAGE}

It's been so long since we've
had some good news! This is all so exciting!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So that's Lady {Yuna}?
Hmmm... No wonder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can see why the {Al Bhed2} would
go after someone like Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It'll be busy with all the wedding
preparations. I'd better get on my feet.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please watch after Lady {Yuna}
until her wedding day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I told my relatives on the {Farplane}
that I'll be joining them soon.
{NEWPAGE}

Now I won't be afraid if
{Sin} comes for me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} all looked so
gloomy. I wonder what happened?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I feel at ease now, thanks to the Hymn.
Now I can go to the {Farplane}
without worry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} all looked so
gloomy. I wonder what happened?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Spira} are in a
state of chaos, but the Hypello are so calm.
{NEWPAGE}

They're a fearless bunch.
You can only admire them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If only Lady {Yunalesca} were here now,
we wouldn't have to live in fear of {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who is using ancient machina
to battle {Sin}?
{NEWPAGE}

Could it be that Lady {Yunalesca}
has risen again after a thousand years?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We beat {Sin} down with machina and the Hymn!
A summoner just needs to finish it off!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Looks like we're
stuck here for a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Might be more {Al Bhed}!
Keep watch, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri}
{Kimahri} fail as guardian on shoopuf.
{Kimahri} never fail again.
