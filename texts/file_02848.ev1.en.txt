{Gatta}
Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta}
Hey, we saw the game!
You guys were great!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
Congratulations, {Wakka}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
It was close, {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Hey! Stop loafing around!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta}
Uh... The lady summoner
and her guardians...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
This mission requires our full attention.
We've no time to waste!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
Understood?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
Yes, ma'am!
Apologies, ma'am!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
Carry on.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
See? Keep your head down,
say "sir" a lot, and you'll do fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta}
Right...sir.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
Hey, {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
Even though {Yevon2} rejected us...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu}
we still believe in you.
That won't ever change.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Thank you, Sir {Luzzu}, Sir {Gatta}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
But, you know... It's not too late
for you to go back to {Besaid}, and...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta}
We should be going, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll defeat {Sin} any way we can!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But {Yevon2}'s teachings say...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Enough!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I-I only meant to...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Are you all right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lady Summoner...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes, I am {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is an honor, my lady.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My name is {Shelinda}.
I am a disciple of {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
What was all that about?
The {Crusader}s' operation?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You mean the one {Gatta} and
{Luzzu} were talking about?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
I heard they were to use forbidden
machina! I had to stop them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Huh? Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The use of machina is strictly
forbidden by the {Yevon2} priesthood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
That's bad, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Let them use whatever they want.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
They still won't defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
But, it's not about defeating {Sin}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
The teachings of Yevon must be upheld!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Yeah! Right!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
But you don't understand!
The {Crusader}s won't even listen to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
And it's all because
I'm just a lowly acolyte.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Don't say that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Well, I haven't been a summoner
for very long myself, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Still, I can't put myself
down every time I fail.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
People are depending on me.
They're depending on both of us!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
Yes! Yes, you're right,
my lady. Absolutely right!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
Thank you so much, Lady {Yuna}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
Now I feel I have the courage
to finish my training.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda}
I will do my best to get myself
appointed to a temple, as a nun.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, take this. Just don't tell
anybody that I was trembling.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are lots of fiends, so stay sharp.
Use this when the going gets tough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Providing is preventing.
Need I say more? This'll help.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here's a little something to
cheer you up before the big fight.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I stocked up on too many.
Please take one, if you like.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I join the {Crusader}s and get thrown
into a major operation right off the bat.
{NEWPAGE}

I mean, you can't blame me for
getting the shakes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm not scared. Don't get me wrong.
I'm just trembling with fury!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you see that sign?
{NEWPAGE}

What a gaudy ad.
They're way out of line.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's not good once those guys get going.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The young guns believe everything
will go as planned.
{NEWPAGE}

We veterans know otherwise;
it's not going to be easy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course when the time comes,
we'll march in full force to victory.
{NEWPAGE}

Victory must be the goal
to win any battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say luck decides the
battle, but we can't afford to lose.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm gonna vanquish {Sin} and
return home a hero.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Us {Crusader}s... We're gonna make
history with this operation.
{NEWPAGE}

For the first time, people other
than summoners will defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No doubt we're gonna win. And just in
case, we have an ace up our sleeves, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the order is given,
I'll be fighting on the front line.
{NEWPAGE}

That's everything we've trained for.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{High Summoner Yocun}, who slew {Sin},
started as a {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I fight as valiantly as Lady {Yocun}
will I, too, receive {Yevon2}'s blessing?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just the other day the {Crusader}s
marched through here.
{NEWPAGE}

Sure is quiet now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I suppose only a summoner can defeat {Sin}.
The teachings are right after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A quiet, beautiful day, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't scare much anymore.
Must be my age.
{NEWPAGE}

If {Sin} happens to show up, so be it.
{NEWPAGE}

I'll just pray as the teachings tell me,
and go straight to the {Farplane}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A quiet, beautiful day, eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A bunch of wounded {Crusader}s
passed by moments ago.
{NEWPAGE}

They were all hanging their heads,
crestfallen. It was too painful to watch.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Cruel punishment for defying the
teachings... Too cruel, I'd say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought about joining the {Crusader}s, but
maybe I should join the warrior monks instead.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The collapse of the {Crusader}s,
the conflict in {Bevelle}...
{NEWPAGE}

I fear for {Spira}'s future.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All we can do is trust the summoners.
I feel so helpless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our {Home} was blown to smithreens.
I am trying not to think about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is good to take a walk like this.
{NEWPAGE}

Sometimes I catch the rascal who
scribbles graffiti in {Al Bhed3}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You probably do not know what
I am saying.
{NEWPAGE}

I am sorry to waste your time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You look awful depressed,
and it's such a beautiful day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I'm feeling down, I come
here and take a walk.
{NEWPAGE}

Nothing like a breath of fresh
air to clear your mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are some things that can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are more and more {Al Bhed2}s coming
here. I don't know if it's good or bad.

--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm still not comfortable being
around {Al Bhed}.
{NEWPAGE}

Maybe I should get to know them,
but I don't speak the language.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry. I don't feel like talking anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just leave me alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I took a bad hit fighting {Sin}.
I couldn't walk for a while.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm all good now, and back to
guarding the Highroad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We couldn't defeat {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

But at least we can protect
the people from fiends.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We should focus on what we can do
and not dwell on what we couldn't do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everybody looks calm, but they are
still afraid of {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

They will always be afraid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sang aloud to release all of my anxiety.
{NEWPAGE}

I was so desperate at the time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm gonna sing whenever I see the
flying ship; I can't help but sing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship will bring about the Calm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even for a moment, a fleeting Calm,
I want to feel peace from my heart.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm going to live to see the day
the Calm dawns on us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fiends often appear here, but
people pass through here, regardless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s terrible attacks continue, and
the fiends' threats persist...
{NEWPAGE}

Yet people continue to move on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Still, fiends are frightening as always.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wush walking and ended up here.
Where am I? What plashe ish thish?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There ish a shtatue ober there.
Shtatue of shumone big?
{NEWPAGE}

Shtatue like it I've sheen shomewhere elshe.
Have you sheen it? Or have you not?
--------------------------------------------------End--
