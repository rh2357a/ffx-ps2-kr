--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monk? She's not around
anymore. I missed my chance at her.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I asked a warrior monk out to the cafe,
but she called me a spoony bard!
Unbelievable!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that Maester
{Seymor} isn't a normal {Guado}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm certain that the {Al Bhed Psyches}
are gonna win this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester Mika seemed well at the
tournament, but I guess there's
no winning against old age.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Kinoc} was always concerned
for the safety of the people.
It's a shame to have lost him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say there are lots of
guys who quit the {Crusader}s and
try to become {blitzball} players.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If anything had happened to {Maester Mika},
the guards would've been toast.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony's going to start soon!
All players must proceed to their locker rooms.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where have the {Crusader}s been hiding?
After that battle they just disappeared...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw the {Luca Goers} were at dock number 3.
Man, those guys were something else!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Kilika Beasts} aren't advancing?
Well, there's always next year...
--------------------------------------------------End--

With me cheering for them, the
{Kilika Beasts} will win hands down!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's going to be busy from now on!
Once the {Calm} arrives,
we're having a huge sale!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't do business with the
temple the way it is. I hope
they get their act together soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm thinking of a new business
that'll cater to warrior monks.
I wonder what they like?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are buying up everything.
Better stock up while you can.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tournaments are when we earn our cash!
There's no time to waste now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The defeated {Al Bhed} are now staying
at different travel agencies. 
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm all for the {Crusader}s and the {Al Bhed}.
Heck, even the stadium uses machina!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The fans always celebrate after the game,
but with the fiend scare, I doubt it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony is about to begin
and you're taking a walk? Now that's bold.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whoever thought of destroying {Sin}
with a song was a genius!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how the wedding was?
Haven't heard anything from the temple yet.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With all these warrior monks,
it feels more like they're
occupying Luca than defending it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This guy in a red robe took down
a fiend in one blow! Is that cool or what?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmmm... A guy in a red coat, huh?
Yeah, I saw someone like that.
Wait, maybe I didn't.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're having a commemorative {blitzball}
tournament when the {Calm} arrives.
We want you to show up, okay? 
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks left Luca without a word.
Who do they think they are?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks seem stronger
than the {Crusader}s. I hope they'll
protect us from now on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Cleaning up after the fiends
will be a nightmare. We'll be up
all night again repairing the stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We've been up all night preparing
for the tournament, so I'm exhausted.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hurray! With the {Crusader}s back I feel
like we could take on two {Sin}s!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only a few have returned alive.
It's the worst defeat in {Crusader} history.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are all taking off.
I hope they'll come back safe.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Auron? Yeah, I know him!
He was a guardian for Lord {Braska}, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Singing together was embarrassing
at first, but once we started,
we couldn't stop.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know much about religion, but
there's something weird about the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With only the {Crusader}s and the
{Al Bhed} helping, no wonder we lost.
Where were the {Ronso}, or the {Guado}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymor}'s aeon may
be able to destroy {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There must be a hundred people
in red out there. How am I
supposed to remember them all?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've got official {blitzball} merchandise
as well as other rare items!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Got any weapons?
{CHOICE:31}Got any items?
{CHOICE:32}Leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come back anytime!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To tell you the truth, I doubt you can destroy
Sin with the Hymn, but you might as well try.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not all of the {Crusader}s are armed well.
They seem inferior to the warrior monks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ship at dock number 3
brought lots of warrior monks
to Luca. I feel much safer now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s may use machina
in their operation. If so, they're
no different from the {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm so worried. What if the fiends
that appeared in the stadium find
their way into the city?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Give them a balloon and they're
happy campers. Kids are so
innocent and easy to please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's that child who helps me to
forget about {Sin}'s existence.
Even if it's only for a moment.

I hope the Calm arrives

--------------------------------------------------End--

My husband likes the warrior monks,
but I simply can't bear them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What if the Crusaders just angered
Sin? What will we do then?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Most of the {Crusader}s that guard our
city have gone off to that "operation."
{NEWPAGE}

{Luca} is defenseless!
Whatever will we do if fiends appear?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I never believed that the fiends
would attack this city. This is horrible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You'll have to excuse my child;
I've never seen her quite so lively.
{NEWPAGE}

Kids will be kids, I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With {Maester Mika2} also in attendance,
this tournament will go down in history.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is Sin really going to go away?
You'd better not be lying to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a flying ship at the port!
That's a forbidden machina, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I feel sorry for the Crusaders.
Everyone is so gloomy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know what? They said that the Crusaders
are bad people disobeying the teachings!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mommy and daddy aren't very happy.
Do you know why? Hmmm?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got a red balloon!
Bet you want one, too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The flying ship's got everyone in
high spirits, but that's no excuse
to neglect our guard duties!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Luca is a free city. The fiends
could have snuck in from anywhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Luca men aren't my type.
They have to be more manly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're going to be closed for awhile.
The manager was badly bit by a fiend.
{NEWPAGE}

Serves him right for leaving me
here while he enjoys the game.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I would've gladly been attacked
by fiends just to see the game live.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The manager said he's going to the game,
so I got stuck looking after the place.
{NEWPAGE}

It's not fair at all. I wanted to watch 
the game and cheer on the Goers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, why don't you go
cheer them on for me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the temple makes mistakes.
The monks are only human, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Luca's so quiet now with all
the blitz fans gone home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the fiends first appeared in
the stadium, I thought it was the
halftime show or something.
{NEWPAGE}

So I just sat and watched--when
suddenly they started rampaging.
I was shocked!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like a good riot once in a while,
but I never want to do that again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hate it when this
cafe is so packed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Every place in town is packed during
the tournament. It's a nightmare
trying to find a place to eat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's wrong with the temple these days?
They're hopeless when we need them most!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a pity about the {Crusader}s.
They were all such devoted fighters.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's all such a big mess, and
I don't know what's going on anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You were on the sphere, right?
Good luck in the game.
{NEWPAGE}

But I still think an {Aurochs}
victory is next to impossible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You understand that those who
belittle {Yevon2}'s teachings will
be excommunicated, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if my brother heard
my hymn up on the {Farplane}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't want to go back to {Guadosalam}
because it reminds me of my brother.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just don't understand why Maester
{Seymor} would choose that woman
when he could have someone like me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother is very strong. That's why
Maester {Seymor} depends on him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's Maester {Seymor} that
protected {Maester Mika2}, right?
{NEWPAGE}

And now, it's my brother that's
guarding Maester {Seymor}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother said that he'd do absolutely
anything for Maester {Seymor}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Have you seen Maester {Seymor}?
What do you think?
He's an absolute dream, isn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} team is worked up
because Maester {Seymor} is
watching, you know!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Whoa!
This is a pretty big town!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Luca is the second
largest city in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I thought every town was little--
you know, like {Besaid} and {Kilika}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Towns don't usually
get bigger than that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Because when a lot of
people start to gather...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
{Sin}...?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What about {Luca}?
It's safe here?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It's not any different,
but the stadium is here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
The {Crusader}s fight to protect it
with all their strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
They protect the stadium?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Blitzball is really the only
entertainment that we have.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Spira}'s a little short
on fun these days.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Whoa!
Talk about pressure!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
That's right!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Is {Zanarkand} like this, too?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Well, there are more buildings.
All tall ones and cramped together.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
They must be so tall!
Don't you ever get dizzy?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Let's go find Sir {Auron}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Where in Spira have you been!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Yuna}'s been kidnapped
by the {Al Bhed Psyches}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
In exchange for her safe return,
they want the {Aurochs} to lose.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
If they're only {blitzball} players,
I doubt they'd do anything drastic.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
But we shouldn't take chances.
Let's go get her. 
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I'm going too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
This will be no problem!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
They're telling the {Aurochs}
to throw the game, as if
they needed to!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I mean, how good a
team can they be?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
{Wakka} said the same thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
He'll take care of the game.
We should go get {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The {Al Bhed} boat is in {Blue}dock 4{White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Let's go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
You're really leavin', Cap'n?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
Shouldn't you heal up first?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
{Yuna} needs me with her now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
I can't be lying
around in some bed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
Yeah, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Come on, look sharp!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
The blitz season just started.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Don't make those faces, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Well...
See you, boys!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
You be good.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Aurochs}
Cap'n...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
I can't hear you!
