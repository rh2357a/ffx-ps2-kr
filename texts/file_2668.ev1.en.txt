Sin is cursed. Sin prays.
It curses its form, it prays for dissolution.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sin sees dreams of its own destruction.
Sin is looking at us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We live in a fading echo of
time left us by the destroyer.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Free him from Yu Yevon.
Free him -- the fayth that has become Sin.
--------------------------------------------------End--
