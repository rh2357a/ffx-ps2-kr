Shoopuf shleeping.
Wait until shoopuf wake up?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seems you destroyed the {Al Bhed2}'s
machina. That's some dedication.
You'll receive a blessing from {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

It'll be necessary to strengthen security so
that the {Al Bhed} won't get their way anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Al Bhed2} hide their green eyes
with goggles. They're known to
resort to petty tricks like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} took my daughter, but I just saw
her again for the first time in five years.
{NEWPAGE}

That {Guadosalam} place was amazing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've seen my daughter, so I have no regrets.
I'm ready for the {Farplane} anytime now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After seeing my dead daughter again,
I felt complete and free of any worry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The wedding will be an absolute joy. It's good
to be able to experience all this, I tell you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought I was lucky not to run into any
wily merchants on this side of the shore.
{NEWPAGE}

But I ended up buying something
from that man over there.
--------------------------------------------------End--

His goods are cheaper than the other merchants',
but he seems kind of suspicious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone seems happy.
Did something good happen?
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} might arrive any time now and
everyone just seems so laid back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

People want to forget their anxiety about {Sin},
so they absorb themselves in festivities.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Al Bhed2} seem docile nowadays,
but it always pays to be cautious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I believe that an {Al Bhed2} conspiracy
is behind all the chaos in the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

An {Al Bhed2} ship is
battling {Sin}, right?
{NEWPAGE}

I'm certain it's a ploy to win
favor with the temple!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the {Al Bhed2} do something nice,
I can't bring myself to trust them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My wife and I ran away
from {Bevelle}.
{NEWPAGE}

I thought we could forget the terror of {Sin}
if we lived in the heart of {Yevon2}...
{NEWPAGE}

Boy, was I wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've expended all my energy coming here
and I can't run any farther.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I could ride the flying ship,
I'm sure I could get back in a jiffy. 
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've expended all my energy coming here
and I can't run any farther.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're hoping to return to
our hometown of {Kilika}.
{NEWPAGE}

First we must cross the {Moonflow}, pass
through {Djose}, then travel the
{Mushroom Rock Road} and the {Mi'ihen Highroad}...
{NEWPAGE}

After that, it's onto the {S.S. Winno}...
Phew! There's a long way to go, isn't there?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how long it'll
take to reach our hometown?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We were lucky we left
{Bevelle} in a hurry.
{NEWPAGE}

If we'd waited much longer to get out,
we would've been killed by {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This area may also become a battlefield...
Perhaps it's better to run farther away?
