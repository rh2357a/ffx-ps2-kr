You'd better hurry!
The game can't start without you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Show us your moves out there, man!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say you've got some tricks
even your old man couldn't do!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dinner's on me if you win!
I even saved a table for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't feel so good...like I'm
on a roller coaster going down.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe all this excitement's
gotten to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hurry up!
The game's about to start!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're counting on you, ace!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Whoa... I got the shivers.
Maybe I'm coming down with something...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you feel cold? Nah, maybe
it's just me. Never mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Man, tickets for tonight's
game cost an arm and a leg!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The tickets were all sold out!
I hope someone's got some extra.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They'll let me in if I say,
"{Tidus} and I are buds," right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't tell anyone else.
It'll be our secret!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aw, too bad...
I would have cheered for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's okay, really!
I'll be fine here...alone...
--------------------------------------------------End--

R-Really?
You're the greatest!
{NEWPAGE}

How can I repay you?
Here, have this!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, well.
It was worth a try.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, well! If it
isn't {Jecht} junior!
--------------------------------------------------End--

From the look on your face,
you'd think you already won!
--------------------------------------------------End--

All of {Zanarkand}'s watching now,
so put on a show for 'em!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Show them what
{blitzball}'s all about!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's gonna be a killer
game tonight. I know it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tonight's game is gonna be
one for the history books!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Zanarkand Abes} are counting
on you! Don't let them down!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You'd better hurry... Or are you
just trying to warm up the crowd?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure you'll get MVP this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You are {Jecht}'s son, after all!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, Mr. Star Player of the Abes!
Do your stuff out there tonight!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Their defense won't
know what hit them!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Careful, the {Zanarkand Duggles}
mean business tonight!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the {Zanarkand Duggles} play dirty!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hit 'em with a {Jecht} Shot, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your dad was the best, {Tidus}.
I wish I had a dad like yours!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Good luck, {Tidus}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, you're gonna be late!
Hurry! Hurry!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Zanarkand Abes} rule!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My mom's a big fan of yours, too!
She said to invite you to dinner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You'd better win tonight,
or I'll deck you one! Pow!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanna play on your team
when I grow up, {Tidus}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was in a coffee shop, running away
from home when I heard the news.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our hero, Jecht, gone.
Vanished into thin air!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My dad must have been his biggest fan.
I knew how sad he'd be.
Heck, we all were that day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

"Zanar," I says to myself,
"What are you thinking?"
--------------------------------------------------End--

I went running straight back home.
We sat up talking 'bout Jecht all night.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My dad and I never talked so much.
Whoa... Didn't mean to reminisce, folks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Anyway... Ten years later, the
Jecht Memorial Cup tournament is today!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The two teams that have won through
to the finals are...of course, the Abes
from A-East, and the Duggles from C-South.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I know there's a lot of people out there
today to see the star of the Abes!
--------------------------------------------------End--

In just one year, he's become
the team's number one player!
--------------------------------------------------End--

He's Jecht's blood, and the new
hope of blitzball! What kind of
super play will he show us today?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Will we see his father's legendary
shot? I don't think I'm the only
one excited here, folks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't you get me a ticket?
I want to see the game up close.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Sure thing.
{CHOICE:31}Sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
