You've beaten my mightiest beast?
Mmm, what extraordinary power!
{NEWPAGE}

All right! From now on, you shall be
known as the "One Who Conquered All!"
--------------------------------------------------End--

I never imagined that my mightiest
creation could be defeated.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes. Truly remarkable!
I can't find any other way to express it!
{NEWPAGE}

All that's left to do is to defeat {Sin}!
I have faith in you, sonny.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There won't be any more new fiends,
but you can still battle them anytime.
{NEWPAGE}

Feel free to come back whenever
you wish to train!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You'll of course need to pay for it, though!
Hahaha...
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a training arena that Lord {Mi'ihen}
constructed for the {Crusader}s.
{NEWPAGE}

You can hone your battle skills here by fighting
fiends gathered from all over {Spira}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But...the fiends all got away
because I, uh, screwed up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm too old to gather fiends now,
so I'm in quite a fix...
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, that's where you come in, sonny!
Can I ask you to round up all the
fiends for me?
{NEWPAGE}

Of course, I'm not asking you to do it
for free. There'll be nice, fat rewards!
{NEWPAGE}

On top of that, you can hone your
fighting skills anytime against the
fiends you bring back here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

In addition, any items you win during
training are yours to keep for free!
{NEWPAGE}

But, there will be a small fee for each
training session, so bear that in mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about it? Not a bad deal, eh?
You won't regret it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm... And I was thinking to reward you
with a variety of rare items I've collected.
Are you sure?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's the spirit, sonny!
Now, go catch all them fiends!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But I've one more warning before
I can let you go.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To catch a fiend, you have to
{Yellow}defeat it with a special kind of weapon{White}!
{NEWPAGE}

But not to worry! I'll sell them
to you for a special low price!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Also, this arena can only hold
ten of each kind of fiend.
{NEWPAGE}

There won't be any bonuses for capturing
more, so keep an eye on your totals!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is an arena where you can train
by battling fiends, but it's closed
because all of the fiends escaped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, I need someone to catch specimens
of every fiend in {Spira} for me.
{NEWPAGE}

If you can bring them back here, I'll
reward you with fantastic items!
{NEWPAGE}

On top of that, you can fight any
fiend anytime, and keep any treasure
you win from them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, the only catch is a small fee
for each training session.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about it? Do we have a deal?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about it? Will you catch
some fiends for me?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need you to start by collecting each
species in the {Calm Lands}.
{NEWPAGE}

I can't reopen the arena without
having some fiends, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the way, there's a total of {Yellow}nine
species{White} in the {Calm Lands}. I'll give
you a bonus when you get all of them.
{NEWPAGE}

Oh! Before I forget, you have to use a
special kind of weapon to catch them!
{NEWPAGE}

I'll sell some to you at a special price!
No, no! No need to thank me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So far, you've collected {VAR12:30} from the
{Calm Lands}. You've got {VAR12:31} more to go.
{NEWPAGE}

You'll find weaker fiends nearby, but go
search the northwest for the big game!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah! You've caught all the fiends of the
{Calm Lands}. Now I can reopen the arena!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oops, I almost forgot. Here's a token
of my appreciation for your hard work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know if you have what
it takes to open it, though.

Head out to {Besaid} and capture
the fiends there. There's so few
kinds, you'll be done in a jiffy. 
--------------------------------------------------End--

Close! Just one more species and we'll
have every kind of fiend on {Besaid Island}!
Keep it up, kiddo!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you've been hunting on
{Besaid Island}, eh? You sure
got there and back in a hurry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about a nice stroll down the
{Mi'ihen Highroad}? They got
fiends to nab and sights to see!

Aha! Just one more species from
the {Mi'ihen Highroad} and we'll have
a complete collection! Hustle, sonny!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I see you've been busy on

the rest and bring 'em to me!

Bring me some fiends from the {Djose} Road.
It ain't a big place, so you'll
be done before you know it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ngah! We're one species short of
having a whole set of {Djose} Road fiends!
Find one and nab it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, so you've been hunting on the
{Djose} Road. I see you've
got quite a menagerie.

How about a hunting trip through the

whole set! Don't give up, kid!

So you caught some fiends out

Been hunting out on the {Thunder Plains}, eh?
Tread lightly, my boy! Tread lightly!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's this cave under a gorge
just north of the {Calm Lands}.
Bring me the fiends there!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why, just one more species
from the cave at the bottom of
the gorge! Get back down there!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you've been spelunking, eh?
Well, keep it up. There's more
fiends to catch in them caverns!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Go hunt for fiends on {Bikanel Island}.
There's gotta be tons of 'em

Lo and behold! One species more and
we'll have every kind from {Bikanel Island}!
Get back out there, son!

fiends, I see. Keep up the good work,

So, you've been doing some hunting
on {Kilika Island}? Well, you still
got a ways to go, I reckon!

I heard there's a bunch of nasty
fiends living inside {Sin}. Maybe
you can go catch some for me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Bingo! Just one more species and
we'll have a complete set from
inside {Sin}! Good luck, sonny!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looks like you've caught some
fiends from inside {Sin}'s guts.
Remember, you're my only hope!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Grim fiends lurk in the dungeon
of the traitor Omega. Can't you
guess what I'm trying to say?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yow! Just one more species
from Omega Dungeon and we'll have
a whole set! Bite the bullet, son!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you're catching fiends
from Omega Dungeon, eh?
Capture more; it'll build character!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know about the hard-shelled
guys, right? I sure want to know
which is the toughest.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need a few more of those
hard-shelled guys. I'm sure
you know where to find more!

Good job gathering them hard-
shelled buggers. Keep on
smashing their shells for me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sure want to find out
where winged imps get their
powers of lightning from.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need just a few more winged
imps to round out my collection!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you've caught some winged
imps, huh? They rely on magic,
so use it against them!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are many kinds of wolven
fiends all over {Spira}.
How about nabbing some for me?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mind catching me a few more wolves?
I need more to continue me research!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I see you're catching wolves, eh?
Don't let them get away!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've been itching to know what
would happen if you mixed flan
of different elements together.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need just a few more flan!
Can't wait to mix them all together!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Been flan-hunting, huh?
Use your weapons, not magic,
if you want to capture them!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Different parts of {Spira} are
home to different kinds of lizards.
Could you go capture some for me?

Can you get some more lizards for me?
Just a few more, now.

poison found in those flying bugs.

beasts that brandish huge horns!

beasts already? Be sure to
duck when they charge!

Sure would be grand to have
every kind of breath-belching
dragon in my collection!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need just a few more dragons
to continue my research!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you've been catching dragons, eh?
Hope you got weapons that
can pierce their scales!

I wonder what makes elementals tick...
Sure wish I had some to study.

I need a few more elementals to complete
my research on the four elements!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you started an elemental collection, eh?
Hit 'em with the element they hate most!

I wonder what fuel those
iron giants run on? Sure wish
I had some to tinker with...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need just a few more iron giants.
They're tough, so be careful.

So you've been capturing
iron giants, eh? Be sure
to stay on your toes!

blow up when you smack them.

Good. You've been gathering
bombs. Be sure to catch them
before they go boom!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want you to nab some
unsavory mushrooms. They might
look tasty, but they ain't!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I need just a couple more mushrooms.
Take care when harvesting!

So you've been gathering mushrooms, eh?
Hit 'em with magic or they'll get upset!
