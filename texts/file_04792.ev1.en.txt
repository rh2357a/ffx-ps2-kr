{CHOICE:31}Absolutely!

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aww, leaving already?
Well, come back again, you hear?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a long wait to ride the
shoopuf since space is limited.
{NEWPAGE}

But summoners get priority since they
need to get on their way to {Zanarkand}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Careful where you shop.
This area is full of cunning merchants.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The merchants are ecstatic about
the maester's marriage plans.
{NEWPAGE}

They're boosting profits by taking
advantage of the people's festive mood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until recently, these merchants
only sold to {Crusader}s.
{NEWPAGE}

They claimed to be giving the {Crusader}s
a deal because of {Operation Mi'ihen}, but
they were really just ripping them off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With all the traitors and {Al Bhed} around,
not many travellers pass through here anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The merchants are suffering
with so few customers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say {Sin} landed in {Bevelle}.
It's better to stay away from the north.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seems the {Guado} won't
come out of {Guadosalam}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was going to return to {Bevelle}
after the tournament in {Luca}...
{NEWPAGE}

but the {Crusader}s blocked the
roads and I couldn't get through. 
--------------------------------------------------End--

My plans are ruined.
Now what am I supposed to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} can't stop
talking about the marriage.
{NEWPAGE}

Well, I guess it's not every
day they hear good news.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to quit the {Crusader}s
and settle down in the country.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So Lady {Yuna}'s getting married, huh?
That's great news.
{NEWPAGE}

I wish the {Crusader}s had defeated
{Sin}... That would've been perfect.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the time we get home, they'll
be celebrating their marriage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome! You seem to
have fine taste, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Listen, buy from me and you won't
have any problems down the line.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, hello there.
Are you in luck today!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you buy something now, I'll give you
a big discount! Well, what do you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Driver
Noo, I don shink sho.
Ish bad idea, yesh.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, we beg of you!

Imposhibibble! Imposhibibble!

{Tidus}
What's wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
This guy won't let
our chocobo on the shoopuf!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It is kinda big.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
It's just not fair!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
He does have a point, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
So, what?
We just leave him behind?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Hey, I didn't say that. Just...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
It is no good.
We will have to find another way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
We will find a ford
where we can cross on foot.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Yes, Captain, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
But...that'll take days!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
Where there's a will, there's a way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Oh, boy...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
That's our captain!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where there's a will, there's a way.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those words stayed with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how Captain
{Lucil} is doing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Let the driver know
when you're ready.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
Riding a shoopuf
isn't THAT much fun.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
How little you know!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Some things little boys
never grow out of!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} & {Tidus}
Right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu}
The merchants here are wily.
Pick your shop well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
Pity.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
There are many things
we do not know about the shoopuf.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
For example, what does it eat?
It eats nothing!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
The water it sucks through its shnoz
somehow supports its considerable size.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
Some theorize it eats teeny-weeny
waterborne organisms.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
And that, as they say, is that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
These shoopuf handlers belong to a race
of water-dwellers known as the Hypello.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
They may be slow on land, but in
the water they're quick as silvery fish!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
You'd think they'd make
admirable players of {blitzball}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
But their lackadaisical disposition
draws them to less strenuous pastimes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
And that, as they say, is that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
I believe I've said
all there is to say.
