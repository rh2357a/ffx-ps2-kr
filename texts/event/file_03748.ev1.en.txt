Hey, did you hear?
They're saying there was a riot in {Bevelle}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks aren't letting
pilgrims into {Bevelle} anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And I came all the way out here
to pray at St. {Bevelle}.
This is such a disappointment.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are so many warrior monks
passing by lately. Did something
happen at the temple?
