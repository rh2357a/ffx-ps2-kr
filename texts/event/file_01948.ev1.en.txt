--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that the temple and
the Al Bhed have joined forces
to fight Sin using a flying ship?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm glad the Crusaders are in high
spirits, but I'm just worried they'll
come up with another reckless plan.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the battle, we could hear the
roaring of the guns all the way to Luca...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We gave up serving the temple.
It wasn't our choice.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just want to sell off this sweaty armor,
and start a new life here in Luca.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Having that airship would make travelling
between Luca and Kilika a lot easier...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We can finally make it back to Kilika,
now that the ferries are running again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just wish the summoners
would end this, already.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sin hasn't attacked lately.
That's making me even more nervous.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I knew the Crusaders wouldn't win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are blustering on about
destroying {Sin}, but, heh... I doubt they will.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear there's going to be another blitz
tournament, to commemorate the Calm!
{NEWPAGE}

If I reserve a bunch of tickets now,
I can make a killing!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Say, you're that blitzer, right?
I expect great things from you
at the next tournament!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The city of Luca keeps on blitzin', even
with all the turmoil goin' on these days.
{NEWPAGE}

Even the faltering of the Yevon temple
won't change that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if Sin were to attack today,
the people of Luca would probably be
more interested in tomorrow's match.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks want it all!
They're asking for VIP seats in the stadium now.
{NEWPAGE}

Who do they think they are, anyway?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks better watch their
step. What goes around comes around!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fiend attack? So what!
Big deal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone'll soon forget about it and
occupy themselves with blitzball.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't wait till next year's tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tch! Everyone went to go
see the opening ceremony.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, ain't ya a blitzer?
What are ya doin' walkin' around?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to that young lady
you were with?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Heh. She dumped ya, eh?
Don't let it get ya down.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, kiddo, got an extra ticket?
I'll buy it off you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Or how about I sell ya front row tickets
for you and the young lady?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh? You're a blitzer, ain'tcha?
Guess ya don't need tickets.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Get your front row tickets here!
Sell your unwanted tickets here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am reporting to you live,
from outside Luca Stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The excitement here has reached
a feverish pitch as the opening
ceremony gets under way... H-Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm in the middle of a broadcast!
Leave me alone!

--------------------------------------------------End--

Many have disdained and shunned the
Al Bhed and their machina for years, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

As I speak, a flying ship, apparently
one of those very machina, has
cornered Sin in its tracks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It may be time for the people of Spira
to question precepts that have stood
for a thousand years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

However, the Yevon temple has kept its silence
ever since Grand Maester Mika's death, and...
Enough already!
--------------------------------------------------End--

In Spira's long history, this could
be the biggest news to ever--
Move! Now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even as faith in the Yevon clergy dwindles,
the temple remains silent, choosing not to
issue any official statement on the matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many are protesting the cold and
insensitive manner in which the
temple has treated the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There have even been reports of a mass exodus
from Bevelle by dejected temple followers...
Wh-What do you think you're doing!?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't you see I'm working here?
You sure are a show-off, aren't you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

As you all know, Operation Mi'ihen
ended in utter failure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the Crusaders annihilated, the warrior
monks and the Guado have been assigned to
take up security posts in various locales.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This dispatch was ordered by Maester
Kinoc and Maester Seymour as they...
H-Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Would you stop interrupting my broadcast?
You get enough attention already!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you know anything about the
fiends inside the stadium?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have so few facts, we can't
write up a feature on it yet.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hm? You want me to interview you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's not like the {Aurochs} are going
to make it past the first round anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why bother with an interview when
we already know the outcome?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of Spira are holding their breaths
as the flying ship begins its attack on...
Move it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have unconfirmed reports that
Maester Seymour has committed an
unspeakable crime... Will you move!?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The mysterious disappearance of the summoners
may somehow be connected to the Al Bhe...
Ahh! Just let me do my job!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've been interviewing eyewitnesses,
but nobody seems to know a thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well... If you win at least one
game, I'll grant you an interview.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh yes, congratulations!
I have a lot more respect
for the {Aurochs} now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did our Hymn of the Fayth
reach the flying ship?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple is in a state of chaos, but we must
remain strong and keep faith in the teachings
as we wait for the Calm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray that the fallen Crusaders may
rest peacefully on the Farplane.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The power of {Master Seymor}'s aeon
was just incredible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can see why he was appointed a
maester at such a young age.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A lady summoner?
Sorry, haven't seen her.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if she did pass by, I
probably wouldn't have noticed,
what with the huge crowd and all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the way, I did hear
someone whistling, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I really don't care which team
wins or loses.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just want to watch the game
and go crazy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I never imagined the Calm would
come during my lifetime.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the mood in Guadosalam is
just as gloomy as the Farplane.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the Crusaders are wiped out,
the warrior monks will protect us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Blue}Sphere Theater{White} is up ahead.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please enjoy revisiting all the
wondrous sights and sounds you've
encountered along your journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple's probably devising a grand plan.
That's why they're not doing anything right now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll be okay as long as the
warrior monks protect us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope those fiends aren't a
harbinger of {Sin}'s coming.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How can you not be excited when the
tournament's about to start soon!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure the people of Kilika were
singing, too. I'm sure of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm just worried that Sin
might attack Kilika again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Kilika Beasts went back home.
I hope they win next year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Kilika Beasts} couldn't play up
to their potential this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can't blame 'em, though. Their island was
recently attacked by {Sin}, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our family has supported the {Kilika Beasts}
ever since my great grandfather's day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let us pray that Yevon will be
watching over the flying ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some of Luca's residents are making
light of the teachings. What sacrilege.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I shall remain in Luca for a while
and spread the word of Yevon
among the citizens.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Glory be to {Master Seymor}'s aeon,
for keeping the destruction to a minimum.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A blessing from {Yevon2}, indeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people are indulging in merrymaking,
but we must keep in mind that...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will spare you the lecture.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We should make a whole bunch of those
flying ships and deliver an all-out attack!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw a flying ship at dock number 1.
Think that's gonna beat Sin?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's too bad about the Crusaders...
I thought for sure their plan would work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe fiends would attack
right in front of the maester, of all people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just goes to show you there is absolutely
no safe haven in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Have you seen a little boy?
My son and I got separated in the crowd.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I told him to whistle
if he ever got lost...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Calm shall infuse new light and
energy into the temple once again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Macalania temple is losing its faith.
I do not wish to live there anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Crusaders defied the precepts and failed.
They should disband for their own good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are devising
a sacrilegious operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear they may be collaborating
with the {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You think I stand out in this temple attire?
Perhaps I should change?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The machina and the Hymn may weaken Sin,
but only a summoner can finish it off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those warrior monks were useless.
They didn't do a thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think the fiend incident was the Al Bhed's doing.
They're always up to no good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Up until last year, it was the {Crusader}s
who were in charge of security.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If they had been here this year, the
fiends would never have appeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't you think it's disrespectful of
the {Al Bhed2} to play in the Yevon Cup?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The flying ship is a forbidden machina, but
we should just get it approved by the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks came in as reinforcements
soon after the Crusaders were defeated.
It was as if they knew the operation would fail.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My buddy's in critical condition after
being attacked by a fiend. Damn it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I feel bad for the {Crusader}s.
They can't even stick around and watch
the game because of the operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the warrior monks invaded Besaid.
They were looking for some traitors.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Aurochs are a completely new team!
They finally have some offense because of you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is the first time I've ever
seen the {Aurochs} win!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're that newbie from the {Aurochs}, right?
Good luck to you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The only thing the people can really
do is to pray for the Calm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why use machina, when we have summoners?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs} really improved this year, but their
success was overshadowed by the fiend incident.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, did you see the lady summoner?
What was she like?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You! You're that traitor!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let him go. Even the two of us
won't be able to overpower him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But, what about our duties
to the temple?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our duties? We missed the ship to Bevelle!
They're not coming back for us!
We're nothing now!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You'd probably kick my butt, anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We wear the armor of the temple,
but it doesn't mean a thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, how did those fiends
break into the stadium?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The authorities have no idea.
They can only assume they just
popped out of nowhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm keeping a close eye on the
{Al Bhed Psyches} this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ewww... Why would you root for the
{Al Bhed2}? You really do have bad taste.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like how they cover up their faces.
It's just so sexy and mysterious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who knows what would have happened
if Maester {Seymor} hadn't been there...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Master Seymor} is our saviour.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, I would have to say it's
the {Ronso Fangs} for me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Ronso2}?
They're just a bunch of meatheads!
--------------------------------------------------End--

And that's why the other teams
are dead meat!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was really surprised by the
sudden fiend attack, but you
know what shocked me the most?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, the {Aurochs} winning the tournament,
right? Yeah, I still can't believe it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? The {Besaid Aurochs}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, come on. Seriously?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What do you say we ditch guard
duty and go have some fun?
--------------------------------------------------End--

H-How can you propose such
a thing? As warriors of Yevon,
we have duties to uphold!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmph! That's the problem with you
temple types. You're too square!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But, you serve the temple, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're in sunny Luca now, so
you should all just loosen up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs} won the tournament.
It must be some kind of mistake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I agree! The authorities should
drop the fiend investigation
and look into this first!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm glad the Goers won, but
I don't feel like celebrating.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah, those fiends really ruined
the whole blitz experience.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how it'll turn out this year?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, duh!
Of course the Goers are gonna win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Psshhh! I know that! What I mean is,
how many goals will Bickson score?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah, Bickson's gonna lead the
Goers to victory as usual.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But you know, Graav's
been doin' well lately.
Maybe he'll be the tournament MVP.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No way! I'm cheering for
Bickson all the way! He is
and will always be number one.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, yeah? Well, my sister's friend's
boyfriend is Graav's cousin!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, I know a guy who's best friends
with Bickson's younger brother!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the Calm comes, I'm planning to travel all
through Spira to film the joyous occasion.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you want to be interviewed, show
us your most outrageous gag, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Stop bothering us! You've already proven
your point at the tournament!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, congratulations!
I got everything on sphere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Never in my wildest dreams did I think
the {Besaid Aurochs} would win the cup.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry, but we're broadcasting
the news about the fiend attack.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, well if it isn't the {Aurochs} comedian.
Thanks for that comic relief!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Keep up the antics throughout the tournament.
I'll be sure to capture you on sphere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony's about to begin.
Shouldn't you be heading back?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that the ferry is out of service?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear {Sin} may still be lurking
in the sea nearby.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At this rate, who knows when
we'll make it back to {Kilika}?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'm sorry, please let me through.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Hey, let's go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You're really famous.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--

{Tidus}
{Yuna}!

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}

--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
In {Zanarkand}, we do this
to cheer on blitz players.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It's not working.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Practice!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Hey, use that if we get separated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Then, I'll come running, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Well, guess we should just
stick together, then,
till you can do it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes, sir!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
You try it, too! Put your fingers
in your mouth like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Like...this?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Uh-uh, not like that.
Like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Then, you just blow.
