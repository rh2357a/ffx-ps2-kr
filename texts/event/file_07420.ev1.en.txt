{Yuna}
Sir {Auron}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Kimahri} told me...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
when my father wanted me taken
from {Bevelle} to {Besaid}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It was you who told {Kimahri}, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I had always wanted
to meet you someday.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I am truly glad that
I had that chance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Having you as a guardian was
so great an honor I don't know
how to thank you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Perhaps if I defeat {Sin},
that will be my thanks to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
That's what I'll do.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes. I will challenge {Sin}.
I will defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
If you are all there watching this,
then I guess {Sin} is already gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
And so am I, I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Anyway, I just wanted to say:
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Sir {Auron}, I thank you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Kimahri}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Do you remember
the first day we met?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I was only seven.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
My father had defeated {Sin},
and all {Bevelle} was celebrating.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Everyone was saying what a hero
my father was. I was so happy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
But when night came,
it occurred to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
My father had defeated {Sin}
and now he was dead.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Now, I was all alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I couldn't sleep, so I wandered
into the town, away from the
celebrating crowds.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I stood on the bridge in {Bevelle}
where my father and I had parted.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Standing there, alone, I could see
the fields where he had fought {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Then, you appeared, {Kimahri}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You said you were looking for
the daughter of {Braska}, remember?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
At first, I was so scared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Until I realized what
a gentle person you are.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You weren't used to
talking to children.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
When I told you that
I was {Braska}'s daughter...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
you said you would take me as
far from {Bevelle} as you could.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
That it was the wish
of a man facing death.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I think...I cried then.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Because that...that was when
I knew my father was dead...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
and I would never see him again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You just held me,
without saying a word.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I cried after we got
to {Besaid}, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
When you tried to go after leaving
me in the care of the temple...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I held on to you, crying,
"Don't go, don't go!"
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
And you listened, {Kimahri}.
You stayed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Kimahri}, thank you.
Thank you so much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
And I've always liked
your broken horn.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
{Wakka}, {Lulu}:
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'll never forget my days spent
with you, growing up in {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
We always played together,
us and {Chappu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
That's why I was always
so happy, I think.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
And when you refused to let me
become a summoner and I did it anyway...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I've always wanted to apologize.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You know, when you tried to stop
me then--really, I was happy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I could tell you
really cared about me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You were like my
big brother and sister.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
No...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I think you really were
my big brother and sister.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
What else...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I love watching you
play {blitzball}, {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I even love it when you
scold me, {Lulu}! Really!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
We haven't even known each
other that long, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It's funny.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
So this is what it feels like.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
It's a much more wonderful feeling
than anything I had ever imagined.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Wonderful...but it hurts, sometimes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I wonder.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
No, I shouldn't say that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'll do that part over.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Um...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Whatcha up to?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I guess that leaves...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
the newest guardian.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Star player of the {Zanarkand Abes}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You are...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I am...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Well, um...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'm glad...I'm glad that we met.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I...I just want to say,
thank you for everything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Maybe...maybe that's why it hurts.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
When I... When I think about us
never being together again at all...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'm afraid.
--------------------------------------------------End--
