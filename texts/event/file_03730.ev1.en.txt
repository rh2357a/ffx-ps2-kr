The road to {Bevelle} is closed.
None may pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's been several days since I
was ordered to guard this road.
{NEWPAGE}

I haven't received any new orders since then...
they better not have forgotten about me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I guess I'll have to keep watch
until I receive new orders.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No entry allowed in {Bevelle}.
Pray somewhere else.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That road's closed.

Hey, did you not hear me the
first time!? Get outta here, kid!
