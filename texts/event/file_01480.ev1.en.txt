He was always alone--
half {Guado}, half man.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanted to give him
the strength to live by himself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And so I became a {fayth}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But...
--------------------------------------------------End--

because I let him taste power,
he began to thirst for more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He was not satisfied with my aeon.
He wanted more. More power.
--------------------------------------------------End--
