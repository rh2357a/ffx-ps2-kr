Hic! Eh...I've been protecting
Maester {Seymor} since he was a wee lad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ask me anything ye want to know 'bout
Maester {Seymor}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}{Seymor} as a young child.
{CHOICE:31}{Seymor} as a young man.
{CHOICE:32}{Seymor} as a monk.
{CHOICE:33}{Seymor} as a summoner.
{CHOICE:34}Don't care to know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Both {Guado} and human blood flow
through Maester {Seymor}'s veins.
{NEWPAGE}

This mixed heritage caused him a
deal of grief in his childhood.
{NEWPAGE}

But because of that very experience...
{NEWPAGE}

he grew to become a great leader
who aspired to bring {Guado} and
humans together in friendship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ye do wanna know more
about Maester {Seymor}, no?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Braska} vanquished {Sin}
when Lord {Seymor} was about your age.
{NEWPAGE}

During the celebration of the Calm's
arrival, {Maester Mika2} ordained
Lord {Jyscal} a maester of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

He praised Lord {Jyscal}'s achievements,
including the conversion of the {Guado2}
to the teachings of Yevon.
{NEWPAGE}

Maester {Seymor} was still a young lad
then, but he tried hard to assist Lord {Jyscal}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As a monk, Maester {Seymor} soon
distinguished himself.
{NEWPAGE}

His accomplishments were many and
acclaimed by all. He shot up through
the ranks quickly, he did.
{NEWPAGE}

Aye, he rose high on his own, never
riding Lord {Jyscal}'s coattails.
{NEWPAGE}

He's truly a remarkable young man.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As a summoner, Maester {Seymor}'s
strength is matchless.
{NEWPAGE}

Yet, he became a maester of {Yevon2}
instead of undertaking the pilgrimage
to battle {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

I think he believes that there's more to a
summoner's duty than just destroying {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't you hold back, now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With {Seymor} gone and
Maester {Mika} dead...
{NEWPAGE}

we've lost all our emotional support.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is truly a disgrace.
Monks are supposed to guide the
people, not behave like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe {Seymor}'s getting married.
It's certainly something to celebrate!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please give this congratulatory gift
to Lady Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Seymor} was first
ordained a monk, he was my junior.
{NEWPAGE}

Now look at him!
He's a maester, betrothed to a summoner.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm absolutely nothing
compared to him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymor} doesn't flaunt his status.
He's a down-to-earth gentleman.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymor}'s actions are inexcusable,
but I cannot condemn him...
{NEWPAGE}

because I remember how he suffered at
the hands of both human and {Guado2}
in his youth.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If he hadn't strayed from the path,
I believe {Seymor} would have
become a fine maester.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester {Seymor} always
smells so nice!
{NEWPAGE}

Isn't he grand?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} used to come here
often, but now, everyone's gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I miss my {Guado} friends.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought I heard a scream!
{NEWPAGE}

I know we're celebrating Maester {Seymor}'s
marriage, but it musn't get out of hand.
--------------------------------------------------End--

These are leftovers from the banquet.
Go ahead, take 'em with you, lad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado} have apparently lost their
willpower and are in low spirits. They
never leave {Guadosalam} anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I feel like shutting myself away in a
temple, too. I just can't believe
anything anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Such a fine day to celebrate!
The monks should let loose today!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Live it up, everyone! Have a
blast and make everyone happy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

With rank set aside like this, I believe
everyone is behaving a little too wildly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Strip away the exterior, and the
devout monk is just another man,
it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you see my cousin outside?
We're always competing with each other.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But unlike him, I'm a diligent worker.
I only sleep on the job sometimes...
Not all the time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
