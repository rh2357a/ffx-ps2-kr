Datto
Hey! You awake?
Cap'n {Wakka}'s waitin' for you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka}'s waitin' for you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanted to believe it
was just a bad dream.
{NEWPAGE}

That this was all a dream and when
I opened my eyes, everything would
be back to normal.
{NEWPAGE}

But, when morning came,
nothing had changed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Daddy...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sea sure looks beautiful
from here, but {Sin}'s lurking
out there, somewhere.
{NEWPAGE}

It gives me the creeps
just thinking about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah, I'm repairing this now,
but it'll all be destroyed
when {Sin} comes again.
{NEWPAGE}

He destroys it, I fix it. I fix
it and he destroys it. It's a
neverending cycle, I tell you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's not just {Kilika}. All of
{Spira} has been ravaged by {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A summoner named {Dona} passed
through here a while ago.
She'll probably be taking the ferry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That {Dona}'s quite an attractive
lady, but she's a bit on the cold
side, if you know what I mean.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everything is in shambles.
I don't know where to start.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's not a smile in all of
Kilika, thanks to {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

But if we win the next tournament,
that should cheer everyone up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our loved ones made it to the
{Farplane} with Lady {Yuna}'s help.
{NEWPAGE}

We are truly grateful
for {Yevon2}'s blessing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure my grandchildren made it
to the {Farplane} in peace.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is a divine punishment
upon the people. There is
nothing we can do about it.
{NEWPAGE}

We can only rely upon {Yevon2}'s
teachings and the summoners
to help us through this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
