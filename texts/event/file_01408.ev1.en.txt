This walkway's not as sturdy
as she used to be. But hey,
no one's fallen through yet!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin}'s been quiet lately, I hear.
Probably off somewhere saving all
its energy for a big assault.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Calm's still not here yet,
is it... What are those people
on that flying ship doing, anyway?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're nearly done repairing
the damage from {Sin}'s attack.
{NEWPAGE}

Folk seem to be in good
spirits these days, but...
Take a closer look at them.
{NEWPAGE}

They're watching the sea, they are,
and there's terror in their eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village may have recovered, but
people's hearts are still heavy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You can always fix what's broken,
but you can't bring back the dead.
{NEWPAGE}

I have to learn to accept
the reality of the situation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sure that our song reached
the people on the {Farplane}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, the {Crusader}s' operation ended
in failure. I knew it would.
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} attacked our homes!
We know its horror all too well.
{NEWPAGE}

The sooner we all accept our fate,
the sooner we can get on with our lives.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What were the {Crusader}s trying
to prove? I just don't get it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that we've finally rebuilt the
village, I'm just praying that {Sin}
doesn't attack again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray each day for a future where my
grandchildren can sleep in peace.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, look at the time.
I'd better be on my way
to pray at the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, now. I forgot
what I was up to.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is a punishment upon {Yevon2}'s
people, yet I fear that no amount
of atonement will end its ravages.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My grandchildren are on the
{Farplane}. How I wish they
could have heard the hymn.
--------------------------------------------------End--
