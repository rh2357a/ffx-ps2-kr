Do you know what those ruins are from?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Some old city?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Correct. A city most ancient!
--------------------------------------------------End--

A terrible testament to {Sin}'s power.
I tremble every time I see them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to {Sin}, humans
are mere mudpuppies!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
But I believe humans are the only
ones capable of defeating {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A good reply. I am relieved to hear
you say that, m'lady summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where are my manners? I am {Maechen},
a scholar. At your service, m'lady.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
I am on a journey, studying the
history of our world, {Spira},
seeking its stories and secrets...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
My travels have taken me
to many places, and I am troubled
by what I have seen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
Fragile smiles on people's faces
crumbling at the mere mention of {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
They are counting on you, m'lady.
Give them a reason
to rejoice once more.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I will.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a statue of Lord {Mi'ihen}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
This is a statue of Lord {Mi'ihen}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Eight centuries ago, he founded a
legion known today as the {Crusader}s.

In just a few short years after
their founding, their ranks grew
throughout {Spira}.

The maesters of {Yevon2} feared

He succeeded in winning the

{Maechen}
Ah, Lady {Yuna}'s guardians,
I presume?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}
Although this is a highroad, fiends
do appear. Be on your guard!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Although this is a highroad,
fiends do appear. Be on your guard!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lady Summoner, I presume?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes, I am {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am {Lucil}, captain of
the {Djose} Chocobo Knights.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And I'm {Elma}. We've been
charged to guard the Highroad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
There have been reports of a large
fiend appearing in this area,
with a taste for chocobos.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
Do take care, Summoner {Yuna},
if you are to rent any chocobos.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Thank you. We will be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil}
Good. We should get back
to our rounds. Farewell.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma}
Our prayers are with you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
A large fiend...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Let's go get him!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
It's the right thing to do.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
It's the right thing to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
What'd I say now?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
{Jecht} said that a lot, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron}
And every time he said it,
it meant trouble for {Braska} and me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, a summoner party.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You, too, are a summoner?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My name is {Belgemine}.
You are...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
My name is {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Ah, the high summoner's daughter.
I've heard much of you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
But you are still fresh
on the road, are you not?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Yes, I am.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
I might have a few
things to teach you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Let us see which are stronger.
My aeons or yours.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
A one-on-one match.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Not to the death, of course.
What do you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Well, it's your decision.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Tell me if you change your mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Have you changed your mind?
You wish to train?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
I'll do my best!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Good.
Before we begin...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Your aeons have been healed. You can
fight with your full strength. Come.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Not bad for one so young.
I underestimated you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Take this.
You've earned it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
You need more training.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
But you did well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
You show promise.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
With more training,
you could defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
But I think you might defeat
{Sin} before I am able to.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
I cannot.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Or should I say...
I was not able to.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You mean...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine}
Farewell, {Yuna}.
We'll meet again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey there, guardians. Here.
Use this to defend our summoner well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a guardian, right?
I'd like to give you this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please give this to the lady summoner
as a token of my gratitude.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear some big operation's about to start.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know what the {Crusader}s
are up to, but I say they're way
out of their league.
{NEWPAGE}

Let the summoners take care of Sin.
It's the only way!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s can't beat {Sin}.
History's proven that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where is he?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got separated from my brother.
I told him to meet here if that happened!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have to get back home
before the operation starts!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s are really active.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard that {Crusader}s are marching
in from all over {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mum's the word. I hear the temples of
{Yevon2} are in on this, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please rest assured. On {Guado}'s
honor, we will guard the Highroad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We should never forget the
folly of {Operation Mi'ihen}.
{NEWPAGE}

Such a tragedy must never
happen again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation's failure should
prove a good lesson to those
who shun the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the ferry's back in service.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are seven legends about
Lord Mi'ihen's statue...
{NEWPAGE}

but they're all so absurd!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say the eyes follow you when
you're not looking, and that it gets up
and walks around in the night!
{NEWPAGE}

Silly, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a legend that Lord Mi'ihen's
sword still exists somewhere.
{NEWPAGE}

I think it's just an ancient myth.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I see a large shadow in the sky sometimes.
{NEWPAGE}

It's too big to be a bird.
What could it be?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe... Nah, it can't be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if somebody's riding that thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fiends are lurking everywhere.
I have to be on my toes constantly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They really need to guard
the Highroad better.
{NEWPAGE}

The {Crusader}s, the warrior monks, I don't
care who handles it, as long as it's safe.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I suppose it's too much to ask to
secure a remote area like this one.
{NEWPAGE}

Out here, it's every man for himself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's gotta be something here...
I can feel it.
{NEWPAGE}

But no matter how hard I look,
I can't find a thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There should be inscriptions
of some sort here.
{NEWPAGE}

Aw, well... I probably wouldn't
be able to read them anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey! What's that?
{NEWPAGE}

Ha!
Made you look!
--------------------------------------------------End--

A lot of people are leaving {Bevelle}. I hear the
temple's really clamping down on things there.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the priests worry more about
themselves than the people.
{NEWPAGE}

If {Maester Mika2} were still alive,
this never would've happened.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe {Sin} fell on {Bevelle} to punish
the temple and what it's become.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From what I hear, {Sin}'s crash into
{Bevelle} has wreaked utter havoc on
the city.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope my warrior-monk cousin
in {Bevelle} is all right.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish somebody would
hurry up and destroy {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord Mi'ihen once passed
along this road.
{NEWPAGE}

With the {Crusader}s in disarray,
I hope to find his guidance here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s shouldn't
focus just on fighting {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

We should strive to establish
peace more than anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Time to buck up and get to work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We all had a swell time singing
when that ship flew over us.
{NEWPAGE}

But we can't truly rejoice
until the Calm comes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what's gonna happen to {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm getting all discombobulated
thinking about it too much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I guess whatever happens happens.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
You have to leave your chocobos here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
Come on, everyone off!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
All the other {Crusader}s are
preparing for the operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
But they put me here on guard duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko}
This is all I'm good for anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hello!
No charge this time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You get to ride a chocobo once for
free, but I see you already have one.
{NEWPAGE}

You can rent one free next time, then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you want to ride a chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you want me to teach you
how to ride a chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please be careful on your trip.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a statue of Lord {Mi'ihen}, who
founded the {Crusader}s several
hundred years ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Mi'ihen} passed along this very
road on his way to {St. Bevelle}.
{NEWPAGE}

Ever since then, this road has been
known as {Mi'ihen Highroad}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Mi'ihen} faithfully followed
the teachings, unlike the {Crusader}s
these days.
