I'm going to pray real hard
so that Sin doesn't come back here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Goers and the Aurochs
are going down!
{NEWPAGE}

I guarantee you, the Beasts are
gonna take home the cup this year!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear {Sin} has gone far away.
My prayers were answered.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you hear? When you see the flying ship,
we're all to sing the Hymn of the Fayth.
{NEWPAGE}

Supposedly, it has something to do with
overcoming {Sin}, but I wonder if it's true?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm still a bit skeptical,
but I guess it's worth trying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, uh... I sang the Hymn of the Fayth,
but what's supposed to happen?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Climbing those stone steps every day has kept
me in shape. Haven't caught a cold in years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I used to be a blitzer back in my day.
Always vying with the other teams.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I recognize your face, sonny.
You were here praying for victory, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not many visitors at the temple these days.
It is a pity, really.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We've decided to leave Kilika, and
look for a place without Sin.
{NEWPAGE}

Who knows if we'll ever find it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Goers look like a pretty good team,
but they're so stuck up, aren't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've had enough of Kilika.
Too many tearful memories here.
{NEWPAGE}

We came to visit the temple one last
time before we leave for good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just saw a summoner and her guardian
enter the Cloister of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When we were training in the forest,
I was confident the operation would succeed.
{NEWPAGE}

But looking back now, I've come to
realize how foolish and naive we were.
{NEWPAGE}

It was a mistake to go against precepts
that have stood for a thousand years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader}s of {Kilika} will disband
soon, and regroup as warrior monks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've given up on becoming a warrior monk.
They favor the temple over the people of Spira.
{NEWPAGE}

I can't believe they abandoned their
positions in {Kilika} and ran off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monk leaders have
barricaded themselves in St. {Bevelle}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the Crusaders are going to fight
Sin without the aid of a summoner.
{NEWPAGE}

Heh, they've got another thing coming.
Haven't they ever heard of divine retribution?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Seeing blitzball players here is a sure
sign that the tournament is approaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have quit the {Crusader}s and have joined
the warrior monks to protect the temple!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monk I respect most is Sir {Auron},
the legendary guardian of High Summoner {Braska}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

No, no, I am not a warrior monk!
I have rejoined the {Crusader}s.
{NEWPAGE}

It's just that we {Crusader}s
are short on armor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}... warrior monk... Who cares?
I just want to protect something!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard famous people come here.
{NEWPAGE}

Where could they be?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wait a minute.
Could they have been the celebrities?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I still have terrible nightmares
of {Sin} attacking our port.
{NEWPAGE}

As a monk, I should be strong enough
to confront my fears, but I cannot!
I am so ashamed!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must be strong and live by the
teachings in this time of turmoil!
{NEWPAGE}

But lately, I have discovered
a weakening of my faith.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must focus on my training
for as long as I am a monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is that flying ship one of Yevon's machina?
Yes, let us assume so.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
You here to pray for victory, too?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Us? Pray?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who needs to pray?
The {Luca Goers} always win!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
Oh, yeah?
Then why are you here?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We've been praying for
some competition this year! 
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, what's your goal this time?
You gonna "do your best" again?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ha! It's too bad your
best isn't good enough!
Why even bother showing up?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
This time, we play to win!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oooh! Play away! Just remember
even kids can play, boys.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka}
See you in the finals!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
We'll beat them.
We have to!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
You know that team?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Putting people down...
They're as bad as my old man!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
But, Sir {Jecht} was
a kind and gentle man!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
Well, not my {Jecht}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even ten years after he left...
--------------------------------------------------End--

just thinking about my old man
got me angry. But maybe that was
just my way of keeping him... Nah.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought I had put my feelings
for {Zanarkand} behind me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But they were there, and they
grew inside me, bigger and bigger,
till I was just about ready to burst.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
Are...are you okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
I...I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}
What do you want to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus}
To scream real loud.
--------------------------------------------------End--

          
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
You sure are talented, man. Playing
blitzball and fighting like that!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
I came here last year to pray for
victory, but we lost in the first round.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto
I guess I didn't pray hard enough, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto
My poor knees were shakin'
when the Goers confronted me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
So this is the place honored in
rememberance of High Summoner {Ohalland}...
Makes you kind of nervous, ya?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
All these flames around the temple...
{NEWPAGE}
Letty
They've always burned strong, ever
since {High Summoner Ohalland}'s time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Letty
That was Bickson.
He's a jerk, but a first-rate blitzer.
--------------------------------------------------End--
