Oh, what a great day!
The breeze must feel wonderful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wanna man the helm?
Yeah, right. Just kidding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So you're with Lady {Yuna}?
That means you're a guardian.
{NEWPAGE}

Hmm... I guess I shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe I'll go have chat with Lady {Yuna}, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There was talk about warrior monks
coming on board to guard the ship.
{NEWPAGE}

But the captain declined the offer.
We can take care of ourselves, he said.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Sin} can't sink this ship, nothing can!
We're guaranteed a safe voyage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's been turmoil on shore, but it's
got nothing to do with us out here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if {Sin} appears, I'll just do
my best to follow the captain's orders.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if it's against {Yevon2}'s teachings,
I want to sail that flying ship!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder who's the captain of that
flying ship? He's probably calm and
cool like our captain.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll arrive in {Kilika} before nightfall.
Go on, take a nap or something.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {S.S. Liki} is funded
by {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ocean weather can be fickle, but
I doubt we'll see any storms today.
{NEWPAGE}

Of course, there is one thing
worse than any storm, and its
coming cannot be foretold...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The cargo that the {Crusader}s loaded
on board worries me. It better not
be anything sacrilegious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a miracle this ship can still sail,
after the stomping {Sin} gave her.
{NEWPAGE}

But I fear some of my crew will
never recover from the ordeal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's hope that the great sea will
ease the pain of a battered sailor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The trouble in the temples has
got me worried. {Yevon2}'s support is
the only thing keeping this ship running.
{NEWPAGE}

These are troubled times, I tell you,
what with {Yevon2} all shaken up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, this ship's survived {Sin}!
She'll weather this, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We can't rely on {Yevon2}'s support
anymore. We plan to go on running
the ship on our own.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We can't let a flying ship get
away with all the glory! Our
pride as seamen is on the line!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Obtained {Jecht}'s sphere!

{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}Take a look.
{CHOICE:31}Leave it alone.
